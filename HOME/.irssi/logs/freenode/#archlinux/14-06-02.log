14:45 grawity │ so basically, take a .docx, feed it to unoconv, and use your favourite lightweight PDF reader

14:47 Earnestly │ narendraj9: Yeah, it's nice, but it's not light
14:47 grawity │ because _dear gods_ not only pdf.js is slow it also eats so much RAM
14:47 demonicm1niac3 │ Earnestly: i am using your old pkgbuild
14:48 nullie │ heh
14:48 grawity │ it's a WinXP box, and it had 1 GB of memory _free_ when I started, and it killed Firefox due to OOM afterwards
14:48 Earnestly │ demonicm1niac3: Clone again and rebuild
14:48 nullie │ pdf.js also wrecks fonts
14:48 demonicm1niac3 │ Earnestly: hm ok
14:48 Earnestly │ grawity: That's impressive
14:48 yanp │ does jfs support falloc/trunc? 
14:48 Earnestly │ demonicm1niac3: Not that much has changed, but always good to test against latest
14:48 yanp │ I cannot find anywhere
14:50 grawity │ yanp: I don't think so, it doesn't define a .fallocate anywhere in its file_operations
14:50 grawity │ yanp: truncate should be supported though, it's a pretty basic feature
