2015-11-16 03:11:38	preaction	i guess the important bit is that everything has to be parsed, the entire script, before anything can be executed. that's how hoisting works: the parse phase creates the names, then the run phase uses them
2015-11-16 03:12:38	preaction	RonRichie: actually, yes. i'd argue that most devs don't know how virtual memory works (though they should at least know what it is)
2015-11-16 03:12:52	RonRichie	preaction thats about how far I know about hoisting and compiling, basically anything that isnt 0 and 1 must be parsed and compiled before our little dummy computer friend can understand it, hah ?:)

2015-11-16 03:15:37	preaction	C compilation requires that the symbols be declared before they're referenced though (header files). and then you've got linking, which whole different ball game. bottomupcs covers that stuff though, iirc

2015-11-16 06:30:39	joeytwiddle	icedwater, i suspect the confusion comes because you have two variables called arg.  when you receive it here function(arg){   it is almost like you have a local variable in that function:  function(){ var arg = arguments[0];   So if you change it inside the function, it only changes the local 'arg', not the 'arg' variable in the HTML!

2015-11-16 13:27:54	flobin	this is maybe a dumb question, but in ES6 you have modules so you can start a file with “import asap from "asap”;”, right? How does the browser or whatever know where to look for the asap file? Does this assume they’re in the same folder? What if they’re not?
2015-11-16 13:28:00	usandfriends	buu: rvalue*
2015-11-16 13:28:10	Sorella	You can do that in Mermaid, by the way: `{ Ref new } value := 2`

2015-11-16 13:28:35	samssh	flobin, It's not a dumb question.
2015-11-16 13:28:36	@buu	flobin: I'm going to guess.. "nothing useful"
2015-11-16 13:28:37	bberry	Sorella, buu: I assume that should set a global variable "x" to 42 (if it was valid js that is)?
2015-11-16 13:28:38	Sorella	!es6 modules @ flobin
2015-11-16 13:28:38	ecmabot	flobin: While ES6 provides syntax for import/export, it currently *does nothing*, anywhere, because the loader spec is not finished ( https://github.com/whatwg/loader ). ES6 Modules are not yet a thing; they do not yet exist. !babel simply transpiles import/export to `require`, which is not guaranteed to work once the loader is finished. Use CommonJS modules for now.
2015-11-16 13:28:51	@buu	bberry: Sure
2015-11-16 13:28:55	bberry	*sigh*
2015-11-16 13:28:59	@buu	Doesn't have to be global
2015-11-16 13:29:04	FailorTwist	 function (){return x}() = 42; would be an err because 2) at block level, the function must have a name; 2) even with a name, it would be function L() { return x} ; () = 12, and () is not an acceptabl lhs actually
2015-11-16 13:29:05	@buu	More fun when it isn't
2015-11-16 13:29:07	flobin	thanks Sorella
2015-11-16 13:29:13	Sorella	flobin: so, TL;DR: there's no such thing as es6 modules yet. Nothing implements it. Babel implements it wrong.
2015-11-16 13:29:23	flobin	gotcha

2015-11-16 13:29:39	bberry	buu: lol well yes, i suppose if you had declared it in an encapsulating scope, itd just set x in that scope.

2015-11-16 13:30:21	usandfriends	nice
2015-11-16 13:30:35	usandfriends	Oh JavaScript....
2015-11-16 13:30:47	Sorella	flobin: the only way of implementing ES6 modules today is to statically compile and link the entire codebase, which would give you a single file. That, however, does not allow you to import anything besides other ES6 modules, so you wouldn't be able to use any module in npm, for example.
2015-11-16 13:30:49	FailorTwist	it actually is function L() { return 12 } and (L ) = 5

2015-11-16 18:11:21	Zero_Zip_Zilch	What is that?
2015-11-16 18:11:32	Sorella	zap0: formulate a theory about it, figure out a minimal test case that reproduces that problem, fix the problem, apply the solution to your codebase, test if it fixes the problem. If not, go back to the start.
2015-11-16 18:11:34	Zero_Zip_Zilch	Or like, is that a shorthand for <script> </script> or something?
2015-11-16 18:11:54	Zero_Zip_Zilch	It's like, using them for templating or something
2015-11-16 18:12:04	Sorella	Zero_Zip_Zilch: HTML has nothing like that, you need to read the documentation for your plugin

I have the following code ----- function destroyer(arr) { console.log(arguments.length; for(var i = 1; i < arguments.length ; i++) { console.log("this should print")}} I call it using the call -- destroyer([1,2], 2, 3), it tells me the argument.length is 3, and it still does not enter the loop and print that statement. wtf is going on :(

2015-11-16 22:07:17	cjohnson	the confusion really only comes in play with variables

2015-11-16 22:07:30	cjohnson	an object is distinct from the variable pointing to it
2015-11-16 22:07:38	cjohnson	the variable's value is a "pointer" to the object
2015-11-16 22:07:50	cjohnson	that's why when you do var a = {}; var b = a; b.foo = 'bar';  a is now {foo: 'bar'}
2015-11-16 22:08:06	cjohnson	you are copying the pointer -- so you have 2 pointers pointing to one object
2015-11-16 22:08:17	soundyogi	so when pointting to a primitive the variable IS the value or points to the value?

2015-11-17 00:43:49	cjohnson	but an array of strings and an array of objects and an array of booleans are all arrays
2015-11-17 00:44:09	cjohnson	many people would recommend it yes -- you are telling the computer that you want to iterate over some values and leaving it up to the computer to decide the best way to do that

2015-11-17 00:48:29	cjohnson	windsurf_: because babel aims to be a long term js transpiler and as "the current version of ES" starts to become a shifting goal peoples codebases will start to break if they ship with "sane defaults"
2015-11-17 00:48:49	cjohnson	so they made the breaking change now and are forcing everybody to start enabling which specific code paths they want to use to avoid that problem

2015-11-17 01:11:19	Sorella	Zak: you can *sort of* catch some of it with abstract interpretation. Mozilla's JSDoctor or whatever did that. But it's not possible in general because you can only know for sure by executing the source code AND you might get different results depending on the values you feed the program.
2015-11-17 01:11:20	cjohnson	or make your web server print out the requests to stdout
