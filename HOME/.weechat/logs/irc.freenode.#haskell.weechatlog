2016-05-31 09:35:10	scepticulous	I recently finished a course on functional programming in haskell and instructor ( erik meijer ) seemed to have a strong opinion to prefer singleton/empty lists over the maybe type in haskell. Is there anybody here that might have a clue about the resoning, maybe some references or quotes or explainations why that might be the case ?
