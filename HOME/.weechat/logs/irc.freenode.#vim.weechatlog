2014-11-25 03:45:32	OliverUv	phy1729: hm, is cursor+col same as using marks? won't a mark be moved down one line if a line is added above the line where the mark is placed?
2014-11-25 03:46:06	phy1729	I honestly couldn't tell you for either.
2014-11-25 03:46:09	OliverUv	i don't mind designating z a trash mark, letting all mappings that need it use it
2014-11-25 03:46:32	phy1729	ok
2014-11-25 03:46:50	OliverUv	marks seem to move as the file is edited, so they maintain their relative position
2014-11-25 03:46:56	OliverUv	so i think i'll stick with using marks

2014-11-27 02:43:15	Rakko	Hi, all. I've noticed that if I have a window with only a few lines in it, and open a split, often the first window is scrolled so that I can't see all the lines -- even though the resulting smaller window still has enough room for all the lines. I'm not using the setting that always keeps a certain number of lines above or below the cursor. How can I fix this?

2014-11-28 01:36:37	nedbat	I'm wondering if anything in vim's semantics requires all the windows to use the same size font? I know it would be an enormous reimplementation task to make it possible, but is there something about the user-visible behavior of vim that would prevent different sized fonts in different windows?
2014-11-28 01:37:21	bairui	nedbat: absolutely; it depends on your terminal's font setting. That is a single font.

2015-04-03 15:07:09	ggVGc	bigeast: afaik, vim's syntax colouring is not smart enough to be able to implement that, since it would require actually evaluating the code, and also you would somehow need to specify to the highlighter what defines you are compiling with

2015-04-03 16:54:07	FinboySlick	I'm trying to do some clever vim-fu.  I'd like to go to all lines that match a criterium, yank them, then paste them 2 lines down. from the match and finally do a quick replace on the pasted line.

2015-04-03 16:58:25	Raimondii	the default range of :g is 1,$ and you can use | to separate ex commands

2015-04-03 19:41:43	dhruvasagar	basically I have a file with ids and some other data, I just want to keep the first occurance of the ids, so something like uniq except the entire line isn't repeated, just this id
2015-04-03 19:41:52	dhruvasagar	would appreciate help
2015-04-03 19:42:24	sakkemo	dhruvasagar: is it OK if you sort them? :sort takes a pattern
2015-04-03 19:42:36	dhruvasagar	sakkemo: it's already sorted, so I just care about adjacent lines

2015-04-03 21:48:09	LeoNerd	Unless your *TERMINAL* can send C-S-n (as a CSIu encoding), then neovim has no more information to go on than vim does

2015-04-03 21:48:43	ZyX-I	LeoNerd: Why this is relevant? Consider me wanting to do `call feedkeys("\<C-S-n>", "t")`. I do not want to have this command depending on the current terminal.

Since they are usually arbitrary anyway, you can either adapt to the changes (different hand position), or remap <abstract-task> to a new combination.

2015-04-03 23:05:51	ZyX-I	orbisvicis: I usually have chain action[->mnemonic->keys]->movements. I.e. `tx` is “to x”, `<C-a>` is “select *A*ll” (or “*A*dd” in Vim). Mnemonic can be omitted if I use combination too often. When I need to press Control+Shift+Left and this is uncommon shortcut I press control modifier, shift modifier and left key which translate to certain finger positions and movements only as the
2015-04-03 23:05:51	ZyX-I	 last stage ([…] was used because very common combinations can be directly executed using muscle memory based on action). Thus when I change something in my keyboard I will only have to omit `[]` (i.e. use explicitly ->mnemonic->keys) and will later get used to new situation because I *always* knew what keycodes are received by the computer. It looks like you try to always use action->movement and *never
2015-04-03 23:05:52	ZyX-I	* remember mnemonic or keys which is the key difference. My variant is convenient because I can naturally express what I am doing *even though* my keyboard layout is very different from other people.

On the flip side, even rarely used mnemonics are hard to remember. And my approach is a compromise between mnemonics and muscle memory: I use tinykeymap to make vim *more* modal.

2015-04-04 01:16:29	watabou	for example, if you have set shiftwidth=4, and you have a line indented to three spaces, using > will then indent it to 4 spaces instead of 7. It will always use shiftwidth setting to figure out the level of indentation when you use > and <

2015-04-04 01:21:28	watabou	The best way to really get it is to try it out. Open a new file, set your desired shiftwidth and then indent a line to something other than shiftwidth setting. And then use > with shiftround turned on.

2015-04-04 02:26:56	drocsid	Hi I'm using vimdiff and I see 4 windows. 3 at the top split (tabs?) equally. Finally the working window at the bottom. Because the lines arent wrapped I can't see all the text contained in the top windows, and I don't know how to switch the focus between them. Can anybody help? Also is there a way to toggle fullscreen between each window?

2015-04-04 20:58:54	fow	fengshaun, it should work and does work for me. What's the output of :scriptnames? your after/plugin/whatever.vim should be listed after any system plugins
2015-04-04 20:59:12	fow	and the after directory itself should be at the end of 'rtp'

2015-04-04 23:18:40	Stalkr	Hi anyone using Emmet with Vim? I'm wondering if it's possible to set an edit point when writing the syntax? For example I have some images `img[src="/images/#{my_edit_point}.jpg" alt="#{next_edit_point}"]*6` -- is this possible? Can't find anything in doc
2015-04-04 23:19:33	Stalkr	Idea is I want to keep /images/#.jpg in the src for all six images

2015-04-04 23:24:33	wilornel	Hey guys! Do you know of a pluggin that would provide context by showing a window at the top of the code which shows the latest openned blocks
2015-04-04 23:25:36	wilornel	For example, if there was a previously openned for loop block but the for loop declaration is too far back (you'd have to scroll back up a couple of lines to see the for loop declaration), then the plugin would show the for loop declaration in side a window at the top

2015-08-26 12:41:06	tyskstil	Hi. I am trying to select (and remove) a column of data in a long data file that I have. I can press CRTL+v to select the top data entry of that column, and then I want the selection to be all the way to the bottom. How do I do this?
2015-08-26 12:41:17	niik00	Hi guys I have probably a stupid question but when I'm typing :map I get of course the mapped keys list. However, I cannot perform a search using / . Is it normal ?
2015-08-26 12:41:29	romainl	tyskstil: G
2015-08-26 12:41:32	tyskstil	Pressing shift+G would go to the bottom, but select everything to the left of the column
2015-08-26 12:42:15	romainl	start your selection vertically then expand horizontally
2015-08-26 12:43:13	romainl	tyskstil: alternatively, https://github.com/coderifous/textobj-word-column.vim
2015-08-26 12:44:14	tyskstil	The column is for instance at character 500 to 505, so If I press shift+G, I have to move the cursor 500 steps to the left to only select the column of interest...
2015-08-26 12:44:28	tyskstil	500 steps to the right I mean
