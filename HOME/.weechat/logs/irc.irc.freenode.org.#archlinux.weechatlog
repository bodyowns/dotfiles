2014-06-18 21:34:35	Tectu_	wlhlm, nope, it does not boot. It's just a blank screen. When I power on, I get to the bootmanager, I boot Arch and from there it's just a blank screen. Not a single line of output
2014-06-18 21:35:16	BrainDamage	double check the execution line that your bootloader uses to spawn linux
2014-06-18 21:35:25	BrainDamage	make sure it addresses the correct hd

2014-06-18 21:35:38	magikfingerz	Hi everybody, I'm trying arch distro, and I have learned that only one kernel(usually the latest) is maintained in the pacman repositories, but I found some others in the AUR, Is it possible to have 2 kernels installed? for example the "official" kernel and the linux-lqx from the AUR...? :)
2014-06-18 21:35:49	Tectu_	BrainDamage, wlhlm, by the way, the -Syu I just did gave me a kernel update as well. Probably related...
2014-06-18 21:35:50	wlhlm	Tectu_: no error messages? try to remove `quiet` from the kernel paramters in the bootloader.
2014-06-18 21:36:06	Namarrgon	magikfingerz: sure
2014-06-18 21:36:17	Tectu_	wlhlm, I have to figure out how to do that in gummiboot first. Never used that one before.

2014-06-18 23:48:17	Earnestly	Lutin`: The problem with PA was in the early days many drivers which relied on buggy and undefined behaviour failed under PA, Lennart chose not to hack around this so they remained until the drivers were eventually fixed.  The second problem was Ubuntu did a very poor job packaging PA which made it worse
2014-06-18 23:48:23	brainwave	I haven't ever used gummiboot , so does it require a .efi extention to vmlinuz to be able to boot it?

2014-06-18 23:50:00	Earnestly	You could, if you can setup pci passthrough, use a virtual machine though, maybe
2014-06-18 23:50:02	brainwave	Ozuma36: why did you want to install so particularly JACK2
2014-06-18 23:50:09	brainwave	Lutin`: he is getting a black screen after boot.
2014-06-18 23:50:25	Ozuma36	brainwave: So I could use it alongside Pulseaudio, which was neccessary for me.
2014-06-18 23:50:26	demonicm1niac3	plus ps2 emulation still barfs on lots of games
2014-06-18 23:50:27	Earnestly	No idea what kind of perf you'll get even with pci passthrough even though it depends a fair bit on the gpu power
2014-06-18 23:50:28	brainwave	I was getting one after my last kernel update as I forgot to copy over the new kernel to my esp/EFI/arch
2014-06-18 23:50:32	demonicm1niac3	it's ok for select games 
2014-06-18 23:50:35	Tectu_	brainwave, well, I don't have any  linux-header  package there. I just have   linux-3.14  and   linux-firmware-xxxx  packages along with some util packages
2014-06-18 23:50:44	Namarrgon	brainwave: there's not much we can do about it, all efi stubloaders will act the same
2014-06-18 23:50:47	Earnestly	demonicm1niac3: It's actually not bad for a large collection of popular titles, surprisingly
2014-06-18 23:50:50	demonicm1niac3	but it's nowhere near overall decent as psx or gamecube
2014-06-18 23:50:53	Lutin`	brainwave: I've never had to manually copy a kernel with ESP mounted to /boot
2014-06-18 23:50:58	demonicm1niac3	Earnestly: yes specific games with hacks for each game
2014-06-18 23:50:59	Earnestly	But some stuff like Jack and Daxter is pretty fail
2014-06-18 23:51:07	Tectu_	Lutin`, that is because he does not have his kernel in /boot but rather in /boot/efi
2014-06-18 23:51:09	Earnestly	demonicm1niac3: It's not that bad, some have hacks true
2014-06-18 23:51:10	demonicm1niac3	Earnestly: it's nowhere near a decent systemd emulator
2014-06-18 23:51:12	Tectu_	Lutin`, my kernel turned out to be fine
2014-06-18 23:51:13	brainwave	Lutin`: that's because of your setup. Mine ESP is mounted to /boot/esp
2014-06-18 23:51:16	Lutin`	Oh..
2014-06-18 23:51:19	brainwave	ESP is /dev/sda1 for me
2014-06-18 23:51:19	Namarrgon	brainwave: only thing to do is to either switch the kernel or use a bootloader that doesn't rely on efistub
2014-06-18 23:51:21	Lutin`	Arch expects /boot
2014-06-18 23:51:26	Earnestly	demonicm1niac3: It's not bad, it's just... assembly
2014-06-18 23:51:41	Earnestly	demonicm1niac3: Stuff like PS2 needs to be an HLE anyway, like PPSSPP
2014-06-18 23:51:44	brainwave	Namarrgon: Then downgrading the kernel is the option.
2014-06-18 23:51:55	Tectu_	brainwave, I'd be thankful if you could give me a hand with the linux-headers package.

2014-06-27 23:34:12	heftig	well, louder means better SNR
2014-06-27 23:34:15	Ozuma36	Louder music has been associated to High quality, but specifically ONLY COMPRESSION. This is why the "Compression Wars" happened.
2014-06-27 23:34:26	Earnestly	beest: If you can show evidence, or explainations, I'll change my mind
2014-06-27 23:34:27	heftig	(assuming you compress and amplify before introducing the noise)
2014-06-27 23:34:30	Ozuma36	Personally, I find stupidly compressed music to sound like CRAP.

2014-06-27 23:36:16	beest	a lot of people both in mixdown and in mastering like to juice it up, yeah, it's dumb, but if recording can get out of it's "plate reverb all the things" phase, this, too, shall pass

2014-06-27 23:38:31	Earnestly	nisstyre: "audiophile" = idiot, basically.
2014-06-27 23:38:31	Toxmi	Cloudef: yes exactly this is waht it seems. But I think it might be a wrong hallucination... does it really 90?
2014-06-27 23:38:51	Earnestly	beest: So perhaps what I hear isn't the result of the loudness "wars" but something else?
2014-06-27 23:38:54	Ozuma36	Are we talking about starter linuxes again?
2014-06-27 23:38:58	beest	Earnestly: because what's used in guitar hero is just tracks and stems, you're basically having a game console mixdown in real time. you're not even getting the same product.
2014-06-27 23:39:05	Cloudef	Toxmi: it was the year when there was still no UX that ruined everything
2014-06-27 23:39:15	Earnestly	beest: No, not in game

2014-06-27 23:39:19	Ozuma36	If we are, go use Linux Mint or Elementary OS.
2014-06-27 23:39:20	Toxmi	actually about the Vim, I personally think the future is in sublime or sth similiar

2014-06-27 23:40:14	Earnestly	"When I first got into the business and was doing a lot of vinyl disc cutting, one producer after another just wanted to have his 45 sound louder than the next guy's so that when the program director at the Top 40 radio station was going through his stack of 45s to decide which two or three he was going to add that week, that the record would kind of jump out to the program director, aurally at least."

2014-07-10 21:05:59	light0	should torrent users be connecting to the proxy then proxy forwards incoming connection through tunnel to me?
2014-07-10 21:06:02	wasamasa	light0: that's where lsof comes in
2014-07-10 21:06:07	wasamasa	light0: it shows you what's happening
2014-07-10 21:06:23	sd1001	Do the options in the /etc/fstab file need to be in a specific order? If yes, which?
2014-07-10 21:06:29	esph	He did ask about what *should* be happening, tbf.
2014-07-10 21:06:30	wasamasa	light0: also, specially designed packet analysis tools like tcpdump, wireshark
2014-07-10 21:06:46	light0	exactly - I'm confused about the principal here
2014-07-10 21:07:06	light0	if the incoming connections is on my local machine and not proxy, then what's point in going through proxy for torrents?

2014-07-11 00:11:29	HER0_01	dedair: It is enabled by default, I'd try turning it off. You'll have to restart your computer, go into the setup (usually pressing f2 before your bootloader comes up) for your motherboard, and find the graphics setting.

2014-07-11 01:56:55	Cirrus_Minor	if using only one DE/WM you do not need a desktop manager, startx with a sane .xinitrc will suffice

2014-07-11 01:57:58	TheAtomicGoose	not sure what i did
2014-07-11 01:58:19	Cirrus_Minor	TheAtomicGoose:  startx with exec xterm means nothing to me
2014-07-11 01:58:30	demize	inanc: The factoid provides a rather important reason.
2014-07-11 01:58:32	TheAtomicGoose	d_garbage: not all of kde what?
2014-07-11 01:58:36	steakwipe	my .xinitrc just has openbox-session
2014-07-11 01:58:56	d_garbage	TheAtomicGoose, not the whole thing, just the bits you want: kde is big :)
2014-07-11 01:59:22	himselfe	if you stick exec <something> in .xinitrc it effectively ends processing of .xinitrc at that line, so you might be looking for something like xterm & if you just want to start xterm along with other stuff
2014-07-11 01:59:33	Cirrus_Minor	steakwipe:  thats all it needs,  now if u have no loginmanager, typing startx will launch openbox
2014-07-11 01:59:37	himselfe	kde is a monster, like gnome
2014-07-11 01:59:46	d_garbage	it is modular
2014-07-11 01:59:52	d_garbage	increasingly so
2014-07-11 01:59:57	himselfe	that's a step in the right direction
2014-07-11 02:00:01	steakwipe	Cirrus_Minor, not sure why you're telling me that, i know how to use my xinitrc
2014-07-11 02:00:02	d_garbage	hope so

2014-07-11 02:00:21	Cirrus_Minor	steakwipe:  its on topic is why
2014-07-11 02:00:29	TheAtomicGoose	Cirrus_Minor: sorry, that was really vague. i edited .xinitrc so that it was the default file with exec xterm added. i did that because in the wiki it said if you would like to test your DW/WM configuration, to stick exec and your window manager in the .xinitrc.

2014-07-11 06:26:55	Phagus	stringy: How do I check that?
2014-07-11 06:27:08	stringy	cat /etc/fstab
2014-07-11 06:27:19	emhs	Especially if the new machine's got an SSD, right?
2014-07-11 06:27:44	Phagus	I used cgdisk to make my partitions
2014-07-11 06:27:55	Phagus	When I did cat /etc/fstab I got nothing
2014-07-11 06:28:02	stringy	are you installing arch?
2014-07-11 06:28:07	Phagus	Yes
2014-07-11 06:28:22	stringy	if so you can use a handy tool in the installation medium called `genfstab` or similar
2014-07-11 06:28:47	Phagus	I haven't even run pacstrap yet.. is this step necessary to do now?
2014-07-11 06:28:55	TheAtomicGoose	If i do sudo systemctl enable lightdm.service and get failed to execute operation: file exists, does that mean that lightdm.service is already enabled?
2014-07-11 06:29:07	TheAtomicGoose	phagus: follow the order of events in the installation guide
2014-07-11 06:29:08	stringy	Phagus: no, sorry I originally thought you were adding swap to an existing install or something

2014-07-11 07:56:22	sirderpalot	nfs, samba, etc..

2014-07-11 09:09:44	mcurran	just a guess
2014-07-11 09:09:49	somethingshort	yeah kind of
2014-07-11 09:09:52	somethingshort	man pkgbuild
2014-07-11 09:10:38	theZacAttack	Somasis: you could install pypy and then just add a local alias python=pypy or whatever
2014-07-11 09:10:46	theZacAttack	if it's worth it, I don't know
2014-07-11 09:10:53	mcurran	It's ten past 3 am, my eyes are not feeling a man page right now
2014-07-11 09:10:55	Somasis	would that not break just about all python things on the system
2014-07-11 09:11:18	theZacAttack	I don't think it would if it's just a local alias
2014-07-11 09:11:23	Somasis	I just wonder if it's possible because from what I read it's faster than normal python, of course that can be debated though
2014-07-11 09:11:24	tigrmesh	mcurran, you don't get it.  you don't need to learn what a pkgbuild is all about.  you need to think about the future of your system and how you'll know 12 weeks or 12 months from now when something was installed and what version it is
2014-07-11 09:11:27	theZacAttack	just for your user
2014-07-11 09:11:38	Somasis	I mean like replacing the entire python installation
2014-07-11 09:11:53	theZacAttack	oh, yeah that may mess some stuff up haha
2014-07-11 09:12:01	Somasis	yeah I had a feeling
2014-07-11 09:12:31	theZacAttack	you could try by instead of doing an alias, do a symlink
2014-07-11 09:12:51	theZacAttack	so that /bin/python points to pypy
2014-07-11 09:12:58	Somasis	hm
2014-07-11 09:13:10	chreuben	Wow. I went away for an hour, came back, and we’re still arguing about pacman...?
2014-07-11 09:13:10	tigrmesh	mcurran, and makepkg is the where the magic happens.  a pkgbuild just says what goes where
2014-07-11 09:13:13	Somasis	perhaps I'll give that a try and hope it doesn't make my system explode
2014-07-11 09:13:27	Somasis	I don't think there's any core things that depend on python
2014-07-11 09:13:28	halosghost	chreuben: same user too
2014-07-11 09:13:44	theZacAttack	if it does fubar some stuff just fix the symlink

2014-07-14 00:23:45	IngCr3at1on	but that is at least partial speculation
2014-07-14 00:23:45	d_garbage	TheAtomicGoose, the 'point' is that you get to both build and *be responsible for* your own system

2014-07-14 00:24:20	d_garbage	TheAtomicGoose, the whole 'arch will not hold your hand' thing is not really a joke, it's a basic principle
2014-07-14 00:24:21	acidfrost	Infandum: talk with the maintainer like Pessimist suggested, though on a wild guess I'd say it will start as an aur package until its considered stable enough to move to extra/community[w/e one it belongs in]

2014-07-14 00:24:59	TheAtomicGoose	d_garbage: i realize that, and i feel that part of it being more complicated is that it allows for more customizability
2014-07-14 00:25:00	d_garbage	TheAtomicGoose, most other distros aren't like that at all, hence my concern
2014-07-14 00:25:18	Infandum	acidfrost: Hm, so if it goes in the AUR first, when it goes into the official repository would there be conflicts up the whazoo?

2014-07-14 00:25:45	Earnestly	It's not elegant
2014-07-14 00:25:55	d_garbage	Earnestly, in what terms? :)
2014-07-14 00:26:01	TheAtomicGoose	d_garbage: i mean complexity in that it is more complex to maintain/use than other distros
2014-07-14 00:26:01	Earnestly	d_garbage: Unix is not elegant
2014-07-14 00:26:11	IngCr3at1on	^

2014-07-14 00:26:21	acidfrost	Infandum: not if it becomes a seperate package, see SDL1.2 and SDL2 packages they are installed in a way that doesn't conflict
2014-07-14 00:26:21	Earnestly	TheAtomicGoose: You think so?
2014-07-14 00:26:31	TheAtomicGoose	Earnestly: yes

2014-07-14 00:26:44	d_garbage	Earnestly, arch as a disrto, in it's philosphy, is
2014-07-14 00:26:46	Earnestly	TheAtomicGoose: I found it harder to reason about convoluted wrappers around basic programs than merely learning to use the programs directly
2014-07-14 00:27:02	Infandum	acidfrost: I guess one could always uninstall from the aur and install it officially. But that worries me still about dependencies.
2014-07-14 00:27:12	d_garbage	TheAtomicGoose, work !=complexity or simplicity :)
2014-07-14 00:27:26	acidfrost	Infandum: if you use the aur package you should uninstall it before installing the one in the official repos 
2014-07-14 00:27:31	d_garbage	or  elegance :P
2014-07-14 00:27:41	IngCr3at1on	I'd have to agree w/ Earnestly. I used Ubuntu and other debian based distros for years, everything is wrapped up in something which just teaches people how to use wrappers rather than the programs themselves
2014-07-14 00:28:02	Earnestly	TheAtomicGoose: Other distros were confusing to me, difficult to understand.  I switched from ubuntu to Arch and while it was a struggle to learn the tty/cli, it ultimately made a lot more sense to me.  This said, I didn't use irc, so i didn't sit around asking for help
2014-07-14 00:28:11	TheAtomicGoose	Earnestly: as someone who came to arch with very limited linux experience, arch 'held my hand' less than other distros and so feels more complex; its workings are not taken care of for you
2014-07-14 00:28:13	acidfrost	Infandum: or continue using the aur version since there is likely to be a git or VCS version of it which will keep you on the bleeding edge with updates from upstream
2014-07-14 00:28:17	Infandum	acidfrost: OK, I think I understand how it will work now. Although I'm not sure if it will be in the aur for long before the official release as kf5 came out almost instantly after release

2014-07-14 00:28:58	Infandum	acidfrost: The aur makes me nervous though--not because of viruses or whatnot, but because it's maintained with the community and so can die out
2014-07-14 00:29:03	d_garbage	TheAtomicGoose, why should they be?

2014-07-14 00:29:29	acidfrost	Infandum: nothing to worry about if one maintainer leaves another will take its place especially on popular packages like kde
2014-07-14 00:29:32	Earnestly	IngCr3at1on: But because Arch doesn't alter upstream, upstream documentation is actually relevant
2014-07-14 00:29:41	TheAtomicGoose	d_garbage: i'm not saying that they should. if i thought that i wouldn't use arch
2014-07-14 00:29:49	IngCr3at1on	very true Earnestly

2014-07-14 00:30:41	Earnestly	TheAtomicGoose: There is a big difference between reasoning about a system and someone making it easy for you.  Just because you can copy and paste code from stackoverflow doesn't mean you have any deeper understanding about it
2014-07-14 00:31:05	TheAtomicGoose	d_garbage: i'm saying that to a user with little experience, arch seems far more complex AND work-intensive (i'm not using those as synonyms) than other distros as the workings are not as hidden.
2014-07-14 00:31:28	Earnestly	TheAtomicGoose: Ubuntu did its best to hide this information from me and no operation was actually explained, it boiled down to "do this and it'll work".  Why are we doing it?  Don't ask, just do it.
2014-07-14 00:31:32	d_garbage	TheAtomicGoose, that is to do with expectations, experience and a whole bunch of other things

2014-07-14 00:31:43	d_garbage	TheAtomicGoose, did you used to use windows?
2014-07-14 00:31:47	Earnestly	TheAtomicGoose: Look at basic stuff like the libdvdcss package, it just says "run install-css.sh", not why
2014-07-14 00:32:03	TheAtomicGoose	Earnestly and d_garbage: i feel as if we are arguing against each other on the same side of things
2014-07-14 00:32:05	TheAtomicGoose	d_garbage: yes
2014-07-14 00:32:07	acidfrost	Infandum: assuming the aur maintainer did their job right you will be alerted to conflicts before pacman changes anything

2014-07-14 18:08:42	phrik	Title: FS#39811 : [linux] Boot hangs after decompressing kernel 3.14 on Haswell chips (at bugs.archlinux.org)
2014-07-14 18:08:42	Xithyl	wait is Go not good now?
2014-07-14 18:08:42	diegoviola	wasamasa: i don't know about rust, it looks nice, but it looks like every week we get new languages and people are overly excited with them, i don't know why

2014-07-14 18:09:22	Earnestly	Computer science has evolved a lot since the 70s, those languages designed 40 years ago haven't really kept up
2014-07-14 18:09:23	woodgiraffe	springworm: mhm, they aren't usable without some wrapper from e.g. bash right?
2014-07-14 18:09:29	hjolt	Rob Pike has gone on record saying that Go was not designed to solve new problems, but to be a less complex language than C++ for writing Google servers.
2014-07-14 18:09:35	pushrax	faster compilation time due to a better architecture from the start, faster development time due to better tooling, etc
2014-07-14 18:09:35	diegoviola	i see
2014-07-14 18:09:35	demize	C gives you the power to shoot yourself in the foot. Rust does too, but only when you explicitly ask for it.
2014-07-14 18:09:42	diegoviola	i'm not against new languages, rust looks nice quite frankly

2014-11-09 18:03:32	sudokode	or doesn't have to be accurate
2014-11-09 18:03:33	MrElendig	partition type doesn't really matter in most cases

2014-11-13 04:55:30	sudokode	I know
2014-11-13 04:55:36	sudokode	I'm subscribed to what the flick
2014-11-13 04:55:41	hunt	theres a lot i get excited about though
2014-11-13 04:55:48	sudokode	fury is still in theaters
2014-11-13 04:55:59	sudokode	I haven't gone to see a movie since me and my gf broke up
2014-11-13 04:56:06	str1ngs	find a new GF?
2014-11-13 04:56:10	sudokode	maybe
2014-11-13 04:56:14	sudokode	they're kinda expensive
2014-11-13 04:56:31	sudokode	I'm hunting for a new job right now

2014-11-13 04:57:17	hunt	such a shame that im going to drop arch
2014-11-13 04:57:20	sudokode	yeah I mean... I may have early access to the dvd...
2014-11-13 04:57:21	hunt	i really dig pacman
2014-11-13 04:57:25	sudokode	totally legit ofc
2014-11-13 04:57:28	str1ngs	you'll be back
2014-11-13 04:57:42	threeifbywhiskey	I suspect he won't, to be honest.
2014-11-13 04:57:46	str1ngs	arch is like the mob, just when you think you are out. it sucks you back in.
2014-11-13 04:58:01	sudokode	more like it beats you back in
2014-11-13 04:58:08	str1ngs	I've been trying to leave arch for like 10 years
2014-11-13 04:58:19	Earnestly	I don't get why you people have problems with it
2014-11-13 04:58:22	blurider	hunt: just run ubuntu on a usb stick and store the games on a drive.
2014-11-13 04:58:30	sudokode	yeah, I never have any issues with arch
2014-11-13 04:58:37	sudokode	not arch-specific problems anyway
2014-11-13 04:58:39	str1ngs	that probably my issue with it haha

2014-11-13 04:59:05	hunt	sudokode: if its not arch specific then is my processor just bugged 
2014-11-13 04:59:08	holomorph	personal problems with arch
2014-11-13 04:59:39	blurider	hunt: It's really hard to tell if your processor's busted.
2014-11-13 04:59:48	holomorph	oh, i guess bd is what i'm really interested in
2014-11-13 04:59:58	blurider	hunt: I'd suggest running some benchmark tests on it if you want to know.
2014-11-13 04:59:59	str1ngs	unless its smokes and catches on fire. then you no for sure.
2014-11-13 05:00:11	hunt	blurider: could that be it? thatd be really weird if that would be the case and it would happen at random times in some steam games

2014-11-13 05:02:44	quantum-mechanic	WAT just 15 dollars 
2014-11-13 05:02:46	sudokode	if a transistor doesn't work, isn't it basically just... losing a little bit of processing power?
2014-11-13 05:02:51	quantum-mechanic	i get 10 dollars for redbull 
2014-11-13 05:03:17	Earnestly	sudokode: idk, sounds like it might have a cascading effect

2014-11-13 05:03:32	sudokode	I don't know

2014-11-13 05:06:27	sudokode	I think it'd be worse to have corrupted cpu cache
