2014-07-20 19:19:10	atrus	wonder if anybody would have a suggestion on an app. i'm in israel for work, and every so often I have to leave my apartment for a few minutes due to a siren saying rockets are coming.
2014-07-20 19:19:49	atrus	i would love to have something running on a camera facing out my window while i'm gone, taking pictures, to maybe get a shot of this, while i'm safe in the concrete shelter next to my apartment.
2014-07-20 19:20:25	atrus	so i was thinking, something that would take a burst of pictures over a few minutes (or even video?) triggered by.... something I can do really quick on my way out of the room
