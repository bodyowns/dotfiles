2014-06-05 04:56:13	schinckel	You may be able to create a manager which does that as part of the get_queryset method, so it always applies.

2014-06-05 05:21:28	a_little_birdie	How will it take that value, through a post or a get?

2014-06-05 07:48:11	jtiai	nikhil_: Because Django doesn't expand variables when accessing context vars.

2014-06-05 09:55:20	Zac12	right now i'm using search to quickly find short(ish) strings such as a title of a song or an album name.. and I'm even wondering if using postgres for such things might be a bit inefficient, maybe i should rather be using a proper search library for partial string searches?

What would be the best way of doing this? Would it be best to follow the relationship and count the plays which the song has or would it be best to add a int field to the song itself called 'play_count' ?
2014-06-05 14:21:33	kezabelle	one, then the other.

2014-06-05 19:14:01	Night_Elf	Hi all. I have a form that I want to use for search. It iterates and builds a choice list like this: "places.append((location.id, location.name))". Then in the form I have:   place = forms.ChoiceField(label='Place', choices=places). There is a problem. If I add a 'place' via the admin interface, it will not show in the list until the server is restarted. How to fix this?

2014-06-07 23:47:16	ub1quit33	avoid the ContentTypes framework?

2014-06-07 23:47:43	dAnjou	yeah, if possible. but this is a very personal advice.
2014-06-07 23:48:00	dAnjou	i've had quite some headaches myself with it
2014-06-07 23:48:03	ub1quit33	haha... believe me, I would LOVE to avoid it... but it may be my only option here
2014-06-07 23:48:15	ub1quit33	so here's what I'm trying to accomplish
2014-06-07 23:48:16	dAnjou	although i understand what it does
2014-06-07 23:48:29	ub1quit33	I have an abstract model called Section
2014-06-07 23:48:33	ub1quit33	to represent sections of a page
2014-06-07 23:48:43	ub1quit33	I subclass it into different types fo sections
2014-06-07 23:48:45	pembo13	generic relations work pretty well for me
2014-06-07 23:49:01	ub1quit33	I have a Page model which I want all of these to tie back to
2014-06-07 23:49:32	ub1quit33	but I want to be able to associate them all under one relationship, not caring about which section type a particular section is
2014-06-07 23:49:57	ub1quit33	so I think the contenttypes framework is the only way to do this
2014-06-07 23:50:09	dAnjou	it is
2014-06-07 23:50:14	ub1quit33	balls
2014-06-07 23:50:28	dAnjou	not the only i guess but the best

2014-06-07 23:52:08	ub1quit33	would it sound like I was on the right track?
2014-06-07 23:52:18	pembo13	ub1quit33: it's not the only way
2014-06-07 23:52:41	pembo13	ub1quit33: you can make Section a concrete model, and make your relations to Section
2014-06-07 23:53:01	ub1quit33	pembo: would that pull in the subclasses of section as well?

2014-06-07 23:53:42	pembo13	ub1quit33: there in lies the issue with that solution, you'd have to write code from "upgrade" an instance from a Section to the appropriate subclass
2014-06-07 23:55:28	ub1quit33	hmm... I see
2014-06-07 23:55:44	dAnjou	ub1quit33: "would it sound like I was on the right track?" <-- yes, try it. then look at the actual database.
2014-06-07 23:55:45	ub1quit33	that sounds like something I could lose a lot of hours doing
2014-06-07 23:55:50	dAnjou	see what it created
2014-06-07 23:56:11	ub1quit33	ah, I should have thought to examine the database

2014-06-07 23:59:49	pembo13	ub1quit33: meaning, you may want a function on your model that would create a subclass instance from your Section instance

2014-07-06 22:19:31	nownot	the url is reading party_id as 2 at that point, right?
2014-07-06 22:19:37	koirikivi	I think you need to change self.request.QUERY_PARAMS to self.kwargs
2014-07-06 22:19:58	koirikivi	the class based views store the variables you specify in the url conf in self.kwargs
2014-07-06 22:20:03	koirikivi	if I recall correctly
2014-07-06 22:20:09	+apollo13	jupp
2014-07-06 22:20:15	+apollo13	self.args and kwargs
2014-07-06 22:20:26	koirikivi	you can print self.request.QUERY_PARAMS and self.kwargs to see how they look like
2014-07-06 22:21:00	+apollo13	but QUERY_PARAMS is afaik request.GET
2014-07-06 22:21:16	+apollo13	isn't query_params just an extension from rest framework?
2014-07-06 22:21:24	koirikivi	yep
2014-07-06 22:21:29	+apollo13	ah
2014-07-06 22:21:39	koirikivi	it's just an alias
2014-07-06 22:21:41	nownot	awesome, thanks for the info
2014-07-06 22:21:45	+apollo13	ok, then it's not the same as args/kwargs
2014-07-06 22:21:49	koirikivi	no probs
2014-07-06 22:21:52	+apollo13	args/kwargs is for url matching
