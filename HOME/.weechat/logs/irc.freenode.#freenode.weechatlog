2014-11-16 18:48:59	XFile345	indeed.  I usually use the IP ban.  just wondered if it was easier using MODE or ChanServ's AKICK
2014-11-16 18:49:09	XFile345	sounds like MODE is the way to go
2014-11-16 18:49:26	Bremsstrahlung	XFile345: ChanServ's AKICK has the advantage that, if you ban by accountname, and the user changes it, ChanServ will track it.
2014-11-16 18:49:43	Bremsstrahlung	That's one thing I found useful.
2014-11-16 18:49:47	XFile345	Would that only work with registered users though?
2014-11-16 18:49:54	Chiyo	sadly so
2014-11-16 18:49:55	Bremsstrahlung	Well, yeah, since you ban by accountname.
2014-11-16 18:49:58	XFile345	gotcha
2014-11-16 18:50:16	Chiyo	but you can always add ip addresses and such, but it won't ban someone if they change ips
2014-11-16 18:50:19	bcode	akicks can be set on unIDed users just fine. They accept hostmasks.

2014-11-17 01:36:26	+Svetlana	Amnasia: it may be a good idea to not take everything said on the web for granted - if people complain that something is unfair, just supporting them blindly may be a bad idea. If you choose to do so, you would have to involve yourself in mediation (hear out both sides and come up with a solution that pleases them both), but picking on one of them might be a bit useless.
2014-11-17 01:36:29	+Svetlana	Amnasia: they would not listen to you, you're an outsider.

2015-11-16 02:36:02	xargs	I think the k-lines are essentially the same thing as a gline since klines are propagated throughout the network
2015-11-16 02:36:17	k6ka	depends on the network. i believe it's so on freenode.
2015-11-16 02:36:17	phroa	k-lines are historically just a ban from a single server on the network, and g-lines are bans on the whole network. charybdis, a server software, offers "clustered" k-lines which propagate between a specified cluster of servers
2015-11-16 02:36:34	phroa	nowadays most people cluster all the servers together. single-server bans are a bit of a relic

2015-11-16 21:29:34	ewew	Can someone tell what displays if i get a +b flag ? If i have +b flag that i am able to connect but not join a room and connection is not unresponsive ? Thank you
2015-11-16 21:29:48	A6358-Guest	I have some screenshots of recipes that I would like to put on 4x6 cards but still be able to read the words. Is there a way to do this or am I going to have to print them out on full sheets of paper? They are not on a computer they are on a tablet not going to type/write them out. Even if they where on a computer my question is still the same. All
2015-11-16 21:29:48	A6358-Guest	 I want to know is if I can print them on 4x6 index cards and have them readable. http://tinypic.com/r/2pt4f1s/9
