2014-11-30 20:48:36	keithn	overall
2014-11-30 20:48:50	PantsDragon2	He’s been up and down. Either he plays lights out

2014-11-30 20:48:56	keithn	stats look decent
2014-11-30 20:48:59	PantsDragon2	So he’s won a lot of games
2014-11-30 20:49:08	PantsDragon2	But when he loses, he tends to lose hard
2014-11-30 20:49:32	keithn	actually he's 25th in save %

2014-11-30 20:52:26	PantsDragon2	Although I live in Winnipeg, a lot of people think he should be the starter
2014-11-30 20:52:47	PantsDragon2	Since they don’t necessaril understand that a backup who plays lights out for a few games may not be able to do it 50 games a year. Especialy a rookie
