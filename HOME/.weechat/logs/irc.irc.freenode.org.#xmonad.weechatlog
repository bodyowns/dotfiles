2014-07-14 17:55:35	geekosaur	I think we listen for that event since we may need to reregister passive key grabs if the layout changes

2014-07-14 17:59:39	Toxmi	but it seems a bit complicated? xmobar has its own Kxb command but that is used for changing the keyboard (I think)
2014-07-14 17:59:52	Toxmi	not an indicator of current state
2014-07-14 18:00:39	Toxmi	geekosaur: Is is a bit complicated?
2014-07-14 18:00:57	geekosaur	er?
2014-07-14 18:01:09	Toxmi	I mean is it straight forward?
2014-07-14 18:01:23	geekosaur	the complication I was talking about earlier was that of changing the event mask xmonad listens on
2014-07-14 18:02:11	Toxmi	hmmm
2014-07-14 18:02:11	geekosaur	in this case, the event mask should already be correct. although I suppose you could say "complicated" because it involves pattern matching and guards
2014-07-14 18:03:02	Toxmi	yes, and also I'm a newbie, so....
2014-07-14 18:03:24	Toxmi	OK thanks, current refresh rate is do the job, HW, not very effecient
2014-07-14 18:05:26	geekosaur	hm, Kbd setting in xmobar listens on the event I said, not a refresh rate?
2014-07-14 18:05:33	geekosaur	s/setting/monitor
2014-07-14 18:06:28	Toxmi	yes, but it doesn't tell me the current keyboard layout, does it?
