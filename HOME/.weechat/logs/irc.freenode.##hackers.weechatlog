2015-11-16 12:50:56	+chris_99	well i don't really do much networking, i just created a simple virtual switch with it heh, and tied nodes to it

2015-11-16 12:51:11	+chris_99	yeah, i know you do proper networky stuff :)

2015-11-16 12:52:59	+chris_99	i wonder
2015-11-16 12:53:26	terabit	hehe, probably , you're the one who likes to actualy experminet with that kind of stuff
2015-11-16 12:53:37	terabit	I don't have the know how
2015-11-16 12:53:52	terabit	of hardware/electronic engineering that is
2015-11-16 12:54:19	terabit	chris_99, but here is a thought , your virtual switch doesn't really need to control the asic
2015-11-16 12:54:32	terabit	well it does..and it doesn't lol
2015-11-16 12:54:47	terabit	what I mean is a clean control vs data plane separation , kinda like how juniper does i
2015-11-16 12:54:49	terabit	it*
2015-11-16 12:55:11	terabit	your fpga/asic functions independently of the virtual switch(es)
2015-11-16 12:55:25	terabit	so if they reboot,go down,get an upgrade,traffic still forwards
2015-11-16 12:55:37	+chris_99	ah yeah
2015-11-16 12:55:57	terabit	they "program" the asic/fpga/hardware  with forwarding table , firewall input table,etc...
2015-11-16 12:56:09	terabit	it has it's own microcode language or something
2015-11-16 12:56:23	terabit	I was thinking about this the other day too
2015-11-16 12:57:02	terabit	what if someone made a pci-e "daughter board" type asic board that performs really well and has it's own tiny OS that functions so long as there is power to it
2015-11-16 12:57:13	terabit	and you can somehow expand the port count
2015-11-16 12:57:29	+chris_99	you mean a network card with a CPU kind of ?
2015-11-16 12:57:30	terabit	I mean that's what juniper is doing essentialy
2015-11-16 12:57:36	terabit	their routers use x86 cpu like normal pc's
2015-11-16 12:57:47	terabit	not cpu, but asic
2015-11-16 12:57:52	+chris_99	ah
2015-11-16 12:57:57	terabit	cpu is generic
2015-11-16 12:58:34	terabit	the problem is in linux/pc user community , when they think of networking, they only think of it from the current devices point of view
2015-11-16 12:58:50	terabit	as in traffic coming to and from applications
2015-11-16 12:59:02	terabit	not transit traffic (between one port and another )
2015-11-16 12:59:20	terabit	that's why I always say , even though you can use linux as a router, it's a terrible OS for that purpose

2015-11-16 12:59:42	terabit	Linux however makes excellent control plane if you use third party software to manage things lol
2015-11-16 13:00:04	terabit	chris_99, ok, in juniper land you have the  Routing Engine and packet forwarding engine
2015-11-16 13:00:16	terabit	routing engine is where junos runs
2015-11-16 13:00:29	terabit	it's x86 cpu board , they are many times redundant (two of them )
2015-11-16 13:00:43	+chris_99	ah ok, so it has a CPU+ASIC?
2015-11-16 13:00:50	terabit	packet forwarding engine is programmed by the routing engine
2015-11-16 13:01:01	terabit	it communicates with th RE but it does not need it to operate
2015-11-16 13:01:19	terabit	sort of , if you look at the entire chassis yeah , it has both
2015-11-16 13:01:31	terabit	the RE is cpu only
2015-11-16 13:01:32	terabit	the PFE is mostly "asic"
2015-11-16 13:02:03	terabit	diffence between the two is that asic is specific to specific purpose while CPU executes generic instructions as they come
2015-11-16 13:02:14	+chris_99	mmm
2015-11-16 13:02:24	terabit	in this case it only needs to be concerned with "how do I forward this traffic" , it doesn't need to do much else
2015-11-16 13:02:43	terabit	either way , the idea is the RE doesn't need asic drivers and what not
2015-11-16 13:02:56	terabit	the don't have freebsd asic drivers for it lol (junos is based on it)
2015-11-16 13:03:05	terabit	the asic stuff has it's own brain
2015-11-16 13:03:27	terabit	even a separate device with an ethernet link to a pc will do the job
2015-11-16 13:03:46	+chris_99	it sounds like the dedicated hardware is what makes it work so well? compared to just using a PC for routing

2015-11-16 13:05:15	+chris_99	oh heh didn't know they where that much
2015-11-16 13:05:17	terabit	because even when there were software crashes and it "rebooted" only the routing engine rebooted
2015-11-16 13:05:50	terabit	the bare chassis with RE is under a mil but when you add the line cards, support contracts,etc... it's in multiple millions

2015-11-16 13:07:53	terabit	a lot of people use cisco too, but juniper's main market has always been internet core , they were the ones that ran the internet backbone back in the NSF internet in the 90's
2015-11-16 13:08:18	+chris_99	wow, 85%!
2015-11-16 13:08:27	+chris_99	i thought cisco was the main provider
2015-11-16 13:08:42	terabit	anyways, it would be great if there was a "protocol" of sorts to communicate routing table and other data between operating systems and asic (not talking SDN)
2015-11-16 13:08:54	terabit	cisco is the main provider of enterprise routing gear
2015-11-16 13:09:23	terabit	with a much higher margin, but that percentage drops when you talk about internet core gear

2015-11-16 13:10:40	terabit	enternrpises mostly use cisco , service providers too , except when it is in the internet core stuff (exchanges mostly iirc)

2015-11-16 15:50:50	terabit	jabberwock, the one thing you don't block in a network is ping, it does not help your security one bit but it prevents legitimate troubleshooting from being performed or from users or system engineers from analyzing the network properly , you may block it on end hosts bot blocking it at the network level is pretty horrible
2015-11-16 15:51:00	terabit	any network admin worth his salt will tell you that
2015-11-16 15:51:04	terabit	you never block ping
2015-11-16 15:51:18	+jabberwock	I'm not
2015-11-16 15:51:18	terabit	that's how you can pick a apart a bad system design or admin
2015-11-16 15:51:21	Obit0	jabberwock: i have a question
2015-11-16 15:51:26	+jabberwock	ok
2015-11-16 15:51:31	terabit	as far as tunnelling goes yeah, it sort of takes advantange of that
2015-11-16 15:52:03	Obit0	why i can not put msg on #offsec chan?
2015-11-16 15:52:03	terabit	but the idea is , ping payload isn't inspected a whole lot
2015-11-16 15:52:12	+jabberwock	Obit0: your nickname is not registered with NickServ
2015-11-16 15:52:27	+chris_99	terabit, on my firewall i just drop all incoming packets

2015-11-16 15:53:06	terabit	you're not really hiding from anyone
2015-11-16 15:53:17	terabit	you can always drop everything but ping
2015-11-16 15:53:36	terabit	then again,it's your own network where you are the only user
2015-11-16 15:53:40	terabit	so it's not a problem
2015-11-16 15:54:23	terabit	the only problem is when there are other people using the network and you have other technical staff administering or functioning in any capacity in the network
2015-11-16 15:54:23	+chris_99	mmm
2015-11-16 15:54:30	terabit	you can always build a wall nobody can penetrate but then you're locked in
