2014-11-12 00:15:36	body	hello,i updated my xmonad.hs config file and after i recompiled it .. i got this errors: https://bpaste.net/show/e86c2b38fe83 , everything was working like a charm before, version i'm using is xmonad 0.11, what could cause this ?
2014-11-12 00:16:18	Welkin	it can't find the modules
2014-11-12 00:16:24	Peaker	felixn: it does - but if you generate a new parsec stream, I think you somehow need to generate the new positions
2014-11-12 00:16:24	Welkin	they must have changed in the new version
2014-11-12 00:16:47	Welkin	body: just use the new config provided by the updated version

2014-11-12 00:17:01	Welkin	I don't use xmonad, so I can't tell you anything more specific than that
2014-11-12 00:17:22	ReinH	Peaker: Pretty sure it reduces to the knapsack problem?
2014-11-12 00:17:24	felixn	Peaker: my preprocessor just strips comments from the source, so I was thinking I could just skip over the comments, and resume the position from the last non comment char

2014-11-12 00:18:30	Welkin	oh, I thought you updated it
2014-11-12 00:18:42	michaelt	body did you install xmonad-contrib?
2014-11-12 00:18:42	body	Welkin: yes, i made the update
2014-11-12 00:18:46	Peaker	ReinH: which is NPC?
2014-11-12 00:19:04	ReinH	Peaker: Right. As long as it isn't bin packing we're OK ;)
2014-11-12 00:19:19	luite	Peaker: when stated with coins it's clear that it's amenable to the quasi-polynomial time solution to subset sum with dynamic programming
2014-11-12 00:19:29	Welkin	body: the errors are obvious

2014-11-12 00:19:33	body	michaelt: let me check, but i had everything installed, 
2014-11-12 00:19:36	Welkin	it can't find the modules specified
2014-11-12 00:19:38	Peaker	ReinH: well, subset sum, knapsack, this coin division problem - are probably all NPC, equivalent up to polynomial conversions

2014-11-12 00:19:51	Welkin	I don't know about xmonad, so that is where my knowledge ends
2014-11-12 00:19:59	luite	Peaker: that's why i mentioned bounded and integral coin values as a requirement
2014-11-12 00:20:01	Peaker	luite: what does the "quasi" refer to?
2014-11-12 00:20:34	michaelt	body, the errors suggest it knows about xmonad-0.11 but some of the modules missing are from xmonad-contrib
2014-11-12 00:20:42	body	Welkin: yea, i understand , the wierd thing is the last time i compiled it it worked like a charm , and now i only changed a variable, and i got all those errors huh
2014-11-12 00:20:56	body	michaelt: i'm building xmonad-contrib again
2014-11-12 00:20:57	body	:)
2014-11-12 00:21:38	luite	Peaker: that it's polynomial time only with respect to a more restricted definition of the problem size
2014-11-12 00:21:41	body	michaelt: fuch yea, how the *%^&* my xmonad-contrib gone away i can't understand
2014-11-12 00:21:48	body	Welkin: fixed :)
2014-11-12 00:22:01	michaelt	body ghc-pkg list will tell you what you have installed .... ghc-pkg list xmonad-contrib will tell you about the package
2014-11-12 00:22:12	michaelt	ah good, body
2014-11-12 00:22:58	luite	Peaker: here it means that if you encode each input with unary encoding, like 11111 for a nickel, then your DP algorithm can solve it in a polynomial number of steps
2014-11-12 00:23:04	body	thank you michaelt :)
