2015-10-12 11:04:43	JunkHunk	hello I am trying to get sensors to show in conky but I don't know how to config this driver : fam15h_power-pci-00c4
2015-10-12 11:04:43	JunkHunk	Adapter: PCI adapter
2015-10-12 11:04:43	JunkHunk	power1:       35.87 W  (crit = 125.02 W)
2015-10-12 11:04:43	JunkHunk	 in the conkyrc file what should I type?
2015-10-12 11:06:47	JunkHunk	this: Power: $alignr ${hwmon 1 power 1} W  shows nothing but this:         Power:       w
2015-10-12 11:44:12	trask	${execi 30 sensors |grep 'temp1' | cut -c16-23}
2015-10-12 11:44:20	trask	is what i use 
2015-10-12 12:27:12	JunkHunk	what does the cut -c16-23 part do?
2015-10-12 12:27:43	trask	execi means bash
2015-10-12 12:27:48	JunkHunk	that config you post gives temperature not power
2015-10-12 12:28:12	trask	yeah you need to find the source, but principle the same
2015-10-12 12:28:47	trask	${execi 50 aticonfig --adapter=0 --od-gettemperature | tail -n1 | gawk '{ printf $5 }'}°C 
2015-10-12 12:28:53	trask	this if it can help
2015-10-12 12:30:09	JunkHunk	what are the 30 or 50 numbers in your config for?
2015-10-12 12:30:33	trask	the 50 determins how often the command should update
