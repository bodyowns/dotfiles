2014-07-04 17:35:50	nath_schwarz	Hi everyone - I have a problem. I've mapped right alt to be my Mode_switch and j, k, l and semicolon to arrow keys, when the right alt key is pressed with Xmodmap. This works fine so far - problem is now, that, when I nmap C-$arrow_key to wincmd $hjkl it works fine with the arrow keys, but not with jkl; - Also, when I try to get the terminal code with ctrl-v in insert mode it just prints the same as if the arrow keys are pressed. Does somebody know a
2014-07-04 17:35:51	nath_schwarz	workaround or why exactly this fails?

2014-07-11 00:39:07	vimgor	Vim uses its own flavour of regular expressions, which is not compatible with Perl's regular expressions. The reason for this is that Ex and Vi, upon which Vim is built, are older than Perl. This essentially affects what special characters you have to escape. For instance, (, ), and + are not magic in Vim regexps. :h magic and :h pattern-overview for a comprehensive overview. Ask me about reghelp.

When I use my config on foreign computer, vim every time fails on "Please install Jedi if you want to use jedi_vim". Little bit annoying. Can I set loading it only when jedi is installed? Or more likely, just catch that error and print nothing? Can you please advice me?
