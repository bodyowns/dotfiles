2015-11-15 21:57:37	@lilmonkey`	body: you can't prevent someone from finding out the action URI of a form, if that's what you mean.
2015-11-15 21:57:48	body	thank you lens, but they don't want to help me 
2015-11-15 21:57:50	body	:))
2015-11-15 21:57:57	@lilmonkey`	Also, for what purpose? I can only think of shady/malicious purposes.
2015-11-15 21:58:16	lens	that's what I thought
2015-11-15 21:58:27	lens	but I've also thought, on occassion, that it's ugly
2015-11-15 21:58:34	 *	lens shrugs
2015-11-15 21:58:37	@lilmonkey`	What.
2015-11-15 21:58:40	body	lilmonkey`: it's for a refferal link ..
2015-11-15 21:58:44	@lilmonkey`	body: and?
2015-11-15 21:58:59	body	basicaly i'm giving people 20$ to invest but they have tu use my referal link
2015-11-15 21:59:09	body	to* use
2015-11-15 21:59:30	lens	lilmonkey`, I'm saying that it looks ugly in my browser when I hover over a URL and have a small box appear somewhere that contains text-value of the URL
2015-11-15 21:59:47	@lilmonkey`	And by ugly you mean useful and informative? Got it.
2015-11-15 22:00:09	lens	I did not make arguments against it being useful or informative
2015-11-15 22:00:28	lens	either way, it don't taste like html soup to me
2015-11-15 22:00:33	@lilmonkey`	Any somewhat tech-savvy and security-minded person would not even click a link if the URI wasn't visible.
2015-11-15 22:02:49	body	yea... that's true
2015-11-15 22:03:37	lens	Let the record show that I never argued against that
2015-11-15 22:03:42	 *	lens slams wooden mallet
2015-11-15 22:04:04	@lilmonkey`	Anyway, the second you said '20$' I knew that you are trying to trick people. Suspicion confirmed, still haven't ever heard of a valid purpose for hiding URI.
2015-11-15 22:04:36	@lilmonkey`	$20 for whoever has one ^_^
2015-11-15 22:04:57	body	i want to help them, but in exchange for that 20$ i want them as a refferal
2015-11-15 22:04:57	body	..
2015-11-15 22:05:01	body	that's all 
2015-11-15 22:05:14	@lilmonkey`	OK, great, but that doesn't require hiding any URIs.
2015-11-15 22:06:03	body	but what most people do it's deleting the referal number and joining normal
2015-11-15 22:06:18	@lilmonkey`	Yes, so you're trying to trick people.
2015-11-15 22:06:25	body	no..
2015-11-15 22:06:45	@lilmonkey`	Yes. Now please stop discussing this, we're done.
2015-11-15 22:07:06	@lilmonkey`	You won't get any support here for shady practices.
2015-11-15 22:07:09	body	really dude, why should i tell you bullshit..
2015-11-15 22:07:12	body	i have no reason for

Howver if you do wget http://www.jpeg.org/images/jpeg-home.jpg  to download the picture, you ll get the raw JPEG data, without any html.  My question is : what is inserting the html code? is it the server or the browser? or wget getting rid of the html?
