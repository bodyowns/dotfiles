2014-11-25 20:27:04	ThiefMaster	also, the kwarg is `methods` and GET is the default so you can omit it altogether.
2014-11-25 20:27:32	ThiefMaster	sounds like you aren't including the hash=... kwarg in the url_for call..
2014-11-25 20:27:36	digia	using flask-restful marshaling functionality. That essentially calls the url_for on flask - https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful/blob/master/flask_restful/fields.py#L286

2014-11-25 20:28:44	ThiefMaster	anyway, check the data of the BuildError
2014-11-25 20:28:51	digia	if i replace <hash> with <int:id> it works.
2014-11-25 20:29:30	ThiefMaster	hmm what of type is the hash?
2014-11-25 20:29:56	digia	hash is just a string

2014-11-25 22:49:19	pybam	Hi there. I have a question regarding the redirect. I want to redirec to a view/route that as exactly one argument, how would the syntax be to do this?
2014-11-25 22:49:35	pybam	SO far i have: return redirect(url_for('show_user'))
2014-11-25 22:49:44	pybam	I want to add an value to that.
2014-11-25 22:49:51	mattupstate	pybam: return redirect(url_for('show_user', user_id=<value>))
2014-11-25 22:49:59	mattupstate	or whatever your parameter name is
