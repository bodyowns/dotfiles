In order to fix it I need to change resolution to anything and then back to 1080p. I tried the following updating my intel graphics drivers, changing cables, changing display port. This error only occurs on reboot. Is there anyway to force the xfce4-settings:display to never change.

I thought I might be better off installing the "official" 2.0.6 from a future release, as opposed to a 3rd party package for the release I'm running. But as mentioned by others, this is probably a bad idea, so I'll stick with the 3rd party repo.

2014-12-02 03:51:18	we6jbo	I have a question
2014-12-02 03:51:22	ineedhelpwithcro	why isnt this crontab working in ubuntu server 14.04 LTS: @reboot /usr/bin/screen -dmS TrollOP /usr/bin/python2.7  /home/TrollOP/willie/willie.py
2014-12-02 03:51:23	ineedhelpwithcro	why isnt this crontab working in ubuntu server 14.04 LTS: @reboot /usr/bin/screen -dmS TrollOP /usr/bin/python2.7  /home/TrollOP/willie/willie.py
2014-12-02 03:51:41	entenienne	if I install ubuntu and don't want it to put its version of grub as the new boot menu (but instead want to keep my old one that another linux dist already have), would I set "Device for boot loader installation" on /dev/sda7 (if sda7 is the partition I am installing ubuntu on) ?

I have a SIP server (Kamailio) that I am using to proxy devices for peer 2 peer VoIP. The iPhone clients can make and receieve calls from a user logged in via a PC but when I try to call another iPhone running the SIP client, the call goes through and connects but I have no audio. Any ideas? Aaaaanything

2014-12-02 05:48:19	farseen	i believe that most part of an ISO stays same between ubuntu updates. So isn't it possible to use a diff tool like the original diff that comes with every distro or the jdiff(jojodiff) to provide the users with older iso files to download the diff and apply it to the older iso to get the new iso rather than forcing them to download the huge iso which is around 900mb. not everyone have unlimited broadband

2014-12-02 06:33:59	felixfilefix	nono - Isn't that to recover a deleted file? I already have the "recovered" file, but, as I said, the encoding's all screwed up. Is scalpel capable of repair? Thanks! Also, there was a suggestion on that linked thread to use a "strings command on the DOC" file. Any idea what that might refer to?
