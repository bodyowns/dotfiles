2014-11-27 01:07:21	body	hello, i can test my mosh server wich i start on my localmachine, and than connect from 2 separate terminals , 2 times as clients, to see how it's working ?
2014-11-27 01:24:16	adek	KeithW: So if you remember I was complaining yesterday about borked display when I scroll in history. It was actually issue with my prompt, some non printable characters screw it up.

2014-11-27 01:46:46	achin	hi body.  only 1 client can connect to a mosh-server instance
2014-11-27 01:47:12	body	achin: oh, my bad
2014-11-27 01:47:30	body	achin: because somebody told me that i can use mosh for pair programming
2014-11-27 01:47:42	body	achin: so this is not possible
2014-11-27 01:48:10	achin	right
2014-11-27 01:48:23	mcpherrin	You can use mosh in conjunction with another piece of software like tmux or screen
2014-11-27 01:48:30	achin	but you can use screen/tmux or tmate for screen-sharing
2014-11-27 01:48:32	mcpherrin	But you can just as easily use ssh
2014-11-27 01:50:03	body	achin: mcpherrin: , but with ssh, if i share a ssh session they could take control of all my $home directory
2014-11-27 01:51:01	mcpherrin	body: mosh is no different
2014-11-27 01:51:13	body	a
2014-11-27 01:51:26	mcpherrin	They can't start another mosh session, I guess, if you just give them the key
2014-11-27 01:51:34	mcpherrin	but they can still do anything in it 
2014-11-27 01:52:32	achin	tmate is really neat and easy to use once installed
2014-11-27 01:52:54	body	achin: the problem i found with tmate
2014-11-27 01:53:33	body	achin: it's that it shares the entire terminal, so if i use my vim configuration the other person it's forced to use too that config
2014-11-27 01:54:05	body	do you have tmate installed?
2014-11-27 01:54:49	achin	yeah, it does share the entire terminal.
2014-11-27 01:55:01	body	yea
2014-11-27 01:55:25	body	so, i think the only one option to be secure... it's to ... make a new user for pair programming
2014-11-27 01:55:25	achin	i don't have tmate installed at the moment
2014-11-27 01:55:48	achin	when you say 'pair programming', do you want two people to edit the same file at the same time?
2014-11-27 01:56:09	achin	or just work on the same project at the same time?
2014-11-27 01:57:27	body	yes
2014-11-27 01:57:30	achin	depending on your project, i wonder if https://www.nitrous.io/ or something similar would work (they claim to support shared/pair programming)
2014-11-27 01:57:52	achin	i have to go do some work around the house, but i'll be back later if you want to bounce some more ideas around
2014-11-27 01:59:45	body	achin: oh, i'll wish u a good work, i gtg now too it's 2:00AM in the night, and in 5 hours i have to go at work XD
2014-11-27 02:00:07	achin	ok, goodnight!
