2014-11-13 20:47:55	halosghost	grzebiel: I prefer to write code that punishes programmer error
2014-11-13 20:48:02	halosghost	grzebiel: by lighting the programmer on fire, for example
2014-11-13 20:48:10	halosghost	I'm so glad that C11 added that in the standard library
2014-11-13 20:48:14	dagle	ornitorrincos: They changed how virtual table works, now it will be the same thing.
2014-11-13 20:48:18	grzebiel	it will be error anyway and it will cause problems anyways. I always prefer my program to crush in case of error than work in some unexpected way
2014-11-13 20:48:24	dagle	And you can call func(apa) instead.
2014-11-13 20:48:33	ornitorrincos	oh, func being a method?
2014-11-13 20:48:40	dagle	yes.
2014-11-13 20:48:51	ornitorrincos	ok, for a moment I though the other way around

2014-11-16 06:24:25	sheep	it's supposed to forward to another channel
2014-11-16 06:24:57	sheep	on other networks you can use /knock, but it doesn't do anything on freenode; /knock is only sent to active ops

2014-11-16 06:26:13	poeticrpm	diegoviola, as you said above, its not like the artists made much from album sales anyways, at least at first. Big artists can make more demands, but new bands get screwed.

2014-11-16 06:26:44	sheep	it's saying you need an invite because you're either in the channel it forwards to, you can't join the channel it forwards to, or you have forwarding disabled (usermode +Q)
2014-11-16 06:27:20	sheep	the way channel forwarding on freenode works is that it only forwards users who can't join due to restrictions like needing an invite or the channel being over its occupancy limit (unless they banned) 
2014-11-16 06:28:03	diegoviola	poeticrpm: yeah to me it sounds like it's this way: artists are unhappy because they don't get much money from the record companies, and they just take it on napster, which has nothing to do with how much money they're getting, I think they're better off cutting their ways with the record companies and just letting the world share their music, they'll probably be happier finding other ways for

2014-11-16 06:29:22	body	aa
2014-11-16 06:29:29	sheep	and you almost certainly don't want to do that since a lot of channels still forward

2014-11-16 06:29:57	poeticrpm	diegoviola, yeah, but it is tough. As money gets harder and harder to come by considering the scarcity of jobs and money, music will be increasingly more difficult to profit from as it is a discretionary expense

2014-11-16 06:30:24	body	aaa i got it sheep thank you for the explain xD
2014-11-16 06:30:47	poeticrpm	diegoviola, I think the faults of our global economic model of commerce has more to do with the decline of the music industry's profits than napster or bittorrent does

2014-11-16 13:43:29	krosos	k
2014-11-16 13:45:50	sd1001	What /is/ the default even? Adwatia or something?
2014-11-16 13:46:03	@grawity	"Adwaita"
2014-11-16 13:46:12	krosos	i don't know
2014-11-16 13:46:17	@grawity	which has a dark variant, by the way
2014-11-16 13:46:21	sd1001	I've always thought that it was adwatia :P
2014-11-16 13:46:32	sd1001	Ohh, cool!
2014-11-16 13:47:06	@grawity	programs like Totem use it by default, but you can also force it globally
2014-11-16 13:47:18	krosos	should this be in a package, the default theme? i stoped caring about the theme for some time now
2014-11-16 13:47:39	krosos	ah yes
2014-11-16 13:47:49	@grawity	Vertex also looks quite nice, though it doesn't understand the 'variant' thing, which is annoying
2014-11-16 13:48:10	krosos	what's the dark theme of adwaita called? simply adwaita dark?
2014-11-16 13:48:10	@grawity	krosos: it used to be in gnome-themes-standard, but as of 3.14 it's now part of gtk itself.
2014-11-16 13:48:26	@grawity	krosos: it's called just "Adwaita"; the dark variant is sort of a sub-theme
2014-11-16 13:48:38	wasamasa	grawity: so no more need for installing the theme package for gtk?
2014-11-16 13:48:44	@grawity	`export GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark` for testing
2014-11-16 13:49:07	@grawity	but to permanently activate it, it's a separate setting in gtk-3.0/settings.ini
2014-11-16 13:49:23	@grawity	gnome-tweak-tool can enable that
2014-11-16 13:49:24	@grawity	wasamasa: right

2014-11-16 13:53:35	@grawity	ooh, Vertex *did* fix the dark variant
2014-11-16 13:54:20	krosos	chromium should use gtk3? setting dark as a variant changed nothing. but i use programs with gtk or qt or anything similar not that often
2014-11-16 13:54:56	wasamasa	at least emacs is using gtk3
2014-11-16 13:55:00	Mion	chromium doens't use gtk at all for rendering
2014-11-16 13:55:14	wasamasa	^
2014-11-16 13:55:14	@grawity	Chromium uses Aura, but in "GTK mode" it takes the colors from the GTK2 theme.
2014-11-16 13:55:14	Mion	it uses gtk3 to grab some info, but that is all
2014-11-16 13:55:22	@grawity	(not from gtk3.)

2014-11-17 03:40:42	luigi	if it's just something that leaves an impression on you, or makes a statement about what the nature of systemd or non systemd users is, then it's not really taking action to prevent you from using something else -- thus not antichoice
2014-11-17 03:40:54	demize	systemd has no obligation to maintain a lot more code just because you want to not use cgroups.
2014-11-17 03:41:32	demize	Being able to reliably kill services is a pretty fundemental thing that systemd is supposed to fix..
2014-11-17 03:41:40	demize	If you don’t want it, fine, use something else.
2014-11-17 03:41:53	demize	That is not “anti-choice” and suggesting it is dumb.
2014-11-17 03:44:14	luigi	I have a question about what is anti-choice -- what about something like google play services where it aids the developer, but forces another party (the OEM of an android device that might run that software) to choose to work with only Google
2014-11-17 03:44:41	demize	luigi: Does it?
2014-11-17 03:44:53	luigi	otherwise they can't run the software

2014-11-17 03:47:16	luigi	Yeah, so I guess the "restrictions" they put on OEMS to be able to ship with Google Play services on android is actually not all that bad
2014-11-17 03:47:33	demize	luigi: That doesn’t say anything about your claim.
2014-11-17 03:48:02	luigi	oh, sorry, developers often utilize functionality provided by google libraries on android, one example being google cloud messenger

2014-11-17 03:49:13	demize	That still doesn’\t back up your claim.

2014-11-17 03:50:12	luigi	oh, hmm you're right. Perhaps I should rephrase and say to work at the behest of google
2014-11-17 03:50:45	luigi	For now Google is happy to place few restrictions on OEMs, but due to the nature of the environment they're creating they have a lot of potential power
2014-11-17 03:50:56	luigi	Maybe some of the systemd haters are opposed on a similar basis?
2014-11-17 03:51:32	luigi	I don't know, FOSS software politics in the Linux kernel seem fundamentally different than other software politics, IMHO
2014-11-17 03:52:29	luigi	err, sorry, not even Linux kernel. the Linux kernel, subsystems, etc. I don't know what word to call it

2014-11-17 04:01:18	luigi	but everything in userspace had to interact with the kernel at some point, right?

2014-11-17 04:01:32	demize	Huh?
2014-11-17 04:01:48	sheep	yeah
2014-11-17 04:01:55	luigi	there's nothing on the machine other than userspace or kernel when you're talking about the things actively running and processing data in a computer
2014-11-17 04:02:23	luigi	right?
2014-11-17 04:02:39	demize	Well, there’s the cpu microcode, but that’s a bit too low level for this discussion, so yes.
2014-11-17 04:02:49	sheep	also device firmware
2014-11-17 04:02:57	luigi	I thought the kernel was the firmware?
2014-11-17 04:03:00	sheep	no
2014-11-17 04:03:20	sheep	the kernel can interact with the firmware or even load firmware into a device though
2014-11-17 04:03:25	luigi	so say a kernel is running on an i386 and it has access to an RTC of kind
2014-11-17 04:03:42	luigi	the RTC could have its own software governing it, and that is firmware on the machine other than the kernel?
2014-11-17 04:04:15	sheep	right, but I doubt that an RTC has anything more complicated than a simple ROM program
2014-11-17 04:04:22	sheep	*a simple program written in ROM
2014-11-17 04:04:32	luigi	I couldn't think of anything else that would be on a mobo offhand
2014-11-17 04:04:38	luigi	maybe a NIC? hmm
2014-11-17 04:04:46	sheep	GPU, NIC, UEFI
2014-11-17 04:04:55	luigi	The UEFI is separate?
2014-11-17 04:05:05	sheep	USB controller, SATA controller, flash memory, HD controllers
2014-11-17 04:05:08	luigi	I thought it was simply the software that ran before the kernel
2014-11-17 04:05:13	demize	BIOS/UEFI firmware are lower level than the kernel.
2014-11-17 04:05:19	sheep	the kernel can still call to the UEFI
2014-11-17 04:05:21	demize	luigi: Indeed.
2014-11-17 04:05:25	sheep	just like it can to the BIOS
2014-11-17 04:05:40	demize	It's the motherboards firmware.
2014-11-17 04:05:44	luigi	what sort of things does it call for?
2014-11-17 04:05:53	luigi	RAM allocation? external resources?
2014-11-17 04:06:05	luigi	I don't understand the purpose of UEFI
2014-11-17 04:06:05	sheep	changing the boot order, getting UEFI configuration, getting ACPI information
2014-11-17 04:06:42	sheep	it's similar to the purpose of a BIOS
2014-11-17 04:06:56	luigi	so for most of the actual computing the OS is doing, it only interacts with the UEFI or BIOS rarely?
2014-11-17 04:07:02	sheep	right
2014-11-17 04:07:02	luigi	err, maybe sparingly

2014-11-17 04:08:13	luigi	and it does this through procedures/physical traces on the CPU itself?
2014-11-17 04:08:33	sheep	to an extent
2014-11-17 04:08:43	luigi	as in, the CPU is physically connected to all these subsystems and the "access" is the ability of the kernel to send some data to those systems
2014-11-17 04:08:46	sheep	usually it calls hardware interrupt signals or writes directly to memory
2014-11-17 04:09:10	sheep	since stuff other than RAM is mapped in memory, like the NIC's buffers
2014-11-17 04:09:40	luigi	the NIC's buffers would be addressed somewhere other than the installed RAM's address space, right?
2014-11-17 04:09:57	luigi	I assume DMA is a way to expose access to these other systems' memory as if it were RAM
2014-11-17 04:10:19	sheep	right, but it would still be in the global physical address space
2014-11-17 04:11:09	luigi	the global physical address space, I assume, is something from the perspective of the kernel/CPU where you can refer to memory with 32 or 64 bits?
2014-11-17 04:11:19	luigi	or some number of bits
2014-11-17 04:11:27	sheep	from the perspective of the MMU

2014-11-18 00:40:19	+dagle	Well. >>= is called bind.
2014-11-18 00:40:25	devil^	We need more classes for -classroom
2014-11-18 00:40:41	+dagle	and =<< is left bind.
2014-11-18 00:41:25	+dagle	And bind says a bit more what the function does than what >>= does.
2014-11-18 00:41:42	+dagle	Since what bind does is to bind a function to a datatype.
2014-11-18 00:42:17	+dagle	Syntax can be extremly nice but also extremly not helping.
2014-11-18 00:42:46	+dagle	You have a hard subject, you can't really understand the idea behind it.
2014-11-18 00:43:12	+dagle	And then comes syntax that can't be read but has to be understood to actually read the examples.

2014-11-20 07:03:29	bougyman	_much_ bigger things than us cause that.
2014-11-20 07:03:56	bougyman	Milankovitch cycles are the main factor in whether are in an interglacial or not.
2014-11-20 07:04:05	bougyman	btw: ice age is normal, this climate is abnormal.
2014-11-20 07:04:18	bougyman	were nearing the end of an interglacial
2014-11-20 07:04:26	bougyman	so the next ice age should be soon.
2014-11-20 07:04:41	bougyman	"soon" in the milankovitch cycle timescale means within the next 50,000 years.

2014-11-20 07:13:27	bougyman	what's most interesting is the aforementioned debate in 'how much we influence it' is between 0.0067 and 0.0284
2014-11-20 07:13:36	bougyman	so .6% or 2.8%

2014-11-20 07:15:11	bougyman	which we don't contribute to in any significant way.
2014-11-20 07:15:23	bougyman	it fluctuates between 8% and 4% per hear.
2014-11-20 07:16:08	bougyman	so ourt 2.8% of 6% of the overall effect vs 0.6% is _much_ less influential than the natural fluctuation in water vapor.
2014-11-20 07:16:43	bougyman	I can't type worth a shit tonight.

2014-11-21 20:20:48	GermainZ	halosghost: is "fuck" a slur?
2014-11-21 20:20:53	@halosghost	no
2014-11-21 20:20:55	@halosghost	it's a curse
2014-11-21 20:20:59	GermainZ	"retard"?
2014-11-21 20:21:03	@halosghost	yes
2014-11-21 20:21:09	GermainZ	phrik: define slur
2014-11-21 20:21:11	+phrik	GermainZ: gcide: Slur \Slur\, n. 1. A mark or stain; hence, a slight reproach or disgrace; a stigma; a reproachful intimation; an innuendo. "Gaining to his name a lasting slur." --South. [1913 Webster] 2. A trick played upon a person; an imposition. [R.] [1913 Webster] 3. (Mus.) A mark, thus [[upslur] or [downslur]], connecting notes that are to be sung to the same syllable, or made in one continued breath of a wind (10 more messages)
2014-11-21 20:21:44	@halosghost	if it is a derogatory term used with specific reference or connotation slighting a particular group, it is a slur

2014-11-21 20:23:41	@halosghost	ohlol

2014-11-21 20:24:01	@halosghost	GermainZ: because they're incredibly offensive
2014-11-21 20:24:23	@halosghost	GermainZ: why not try to avoid being incredibly offensive when it has no negative affect to do so?
2014-11-21 20:24:34	jl	GermainZ: Because it’s offensive and creates the kind of environment that causes lots of nice people to abhor this channel.

2014-11-28 07:26:41	Celti	Monochromatic with complement is basically the only colour scheme worth using for the vast majority of applications, in my not-so-humble opinion.

2014-11-28 07:28:44	@meskarune	well depends. A video game can have lots of colors, but they should be harmonious unless you want to intentionally create the opposite effect with clashing colors

2014-11-28 23:46:11	+Achillion	The fork is the actual solution that this particular group wants and they're getting it. So you don't have to listen to them any more. You have NOTHING for them. When someone complains to you about X distro using systemd, you can politely tell them about this flashy new debian fork and if they don't like it, then you have every single right to tell them to go fuck themselves.

2014-11-28 23:49:38	wasamasa	"Considering how far this has propagated today and the

2014-11-28 23:52:13	+taotetek	sustrik abandoned crossroads after awhile and started nanomsg
2014-11-28 23:52:38	+taotetek	with rather different goals
2014-11-28 23:52:40	+taotetek	it's a neat project
2014-11-28 23:52:41	+Achillion	First time I saw someone complain about systemd, my first response was "just use something that doesn't have systemd". Then it became "well now every distro is using systemd" and the response was "so make your own" ... and now this. So it's all going according to plan in my book
2014-11-28 23:52:55	wasamasa	Achillion: it's not like it's about systemd at all, a thing nobody will ever run into
2014-11-28 23:53:45	+Achillion	I don't follow. Is that sarcasm? Are you saying that everybody will run into systemd and so I should care and be angry?
2014-11-28 23:54:13	wasamasa	I will inevitably bump into people bitching about systemd, no matter whether this fork exists or not

2014-11-29 00:57:18	wasamasa	hmm
2014-11-29 00:57:48	wasamasa	I'd rather propose a website to be put up where people can still query the old db and if they find anything they like, they can add it to the new db
2014-11-29 00:58:01	@tigrmesh	i think we'll be going with separate DBs for each channel. it would be nice to know the popular ones to populate all the channels

2014-11-29 00:59:48	wasamasa	it would be kind of silly if I couldn't use #archlinux factoids over at #archlinux-offtopic

2014-11-29 01:02:51	@tigrmesh	they'll end up here

2014-11-29 01:15:32	@tigrmesh	wasamasa, there are 2 issues.  one is that #archlinux needs a cleaned up factoids DB.  the current factoids DB is full of dead links and trash from -ot (and other places).
2014-11-29 01:16:49	@tigrmesh	so what would probably happen is that -ot will get the old one.  and no other channels will access that

2014-11-29 23:27:56	krosos	oh
2014-11-29 23:28:04	GI_Jack	was to control the mobs of disaffected urban poor
2014-11-29 23:28:15	GI_Jack	modern policing started in europe
2014-11-29 23:28:46	escondida	GI_Jack: Being from Texas, though a relatively non-crazy city, over my lifetime I've witnessed enough drunk people driving around waving guns to want stricter controls.
2014-11-29 23:28:56	krosos	i think i read something regarding the sheriff star sign thing and connected it wrong
2014-11-29 23:29:28	GI_Jack	krosos, the concept we have of a sherrif pre-dates modern policing
2014-11-29 23:29:46	GI_Jack	sherrifs are elected, and was the original means of police in the US
2014-11-29 23:30:02	GI_Jack	an elected law man, who could deputize if need by citizens if a threat got out of control
2014-11-29 23:30:17	GI_Jack	but no real large standing police force
2014-11-29 23:31:01	GI_Jack	escondida, I live in NJ, and I've seen enough unarmed people get robbed at gunpoint to want less gun control

2014-11-29 23:32:04	escondida	But of course, as with any position of power, the effectiveness of the sheriff for controlling actual crime and not abusing the power depends on the individual...and there were *plenty* of corrupt sheriffs.

2014-11-30 01:57:32	diegoviola	if they want to provide an alternative to systemd, they have to be skilled and actually provide something that is of similar quality

2014-11-30 02:00:10	GI_Jack	to be honest, debian initscripts are terrible, if they wanted a more UNIXy alternative I'd go with systemd, because its fairly standard, and cross platform, working accross diffrent kernels even

2014-11-30 22:01:37	GI_Jack	haha, that too
2014-11-30 22:01:56	GI_Jack	most places I'd go gave you the shareware and the crack, and sometimes just the cracked full version
2014-11-30 22:02:23	+Achillion	I think I was playing it "smart" and went to places like tucows to get the latest version and then searched for the crack, because bundled versions were sometimes outdated
2014-11-30 22:02:42	GI_Jack	yeah, but the crack needed to match the version
2014-11-30 22:02:49	+Achillion	but there was also stuff that was freeware or you could use fine as shareware so I stuck with that

2014-11-30 22:07:39	+Achillion	I knew a couple of people who used Linux back then
2014-11-30 22:07:42	krosos	i think i came to linux originally at the end of the 90s because some of the people I hang out in school used it.
2014-11-30 22:07:47	+Achillion	and I wondered if I could handle it
2014-11-30 22:08:06	+Achillion	and I remember calling one of them one day and asking if he could lend me CDs so I could install it, but I didn't have the space
2014-11-30 22:08:24	+Achillion	so I was thinking about compressing my drive (using the windows partition compression) and installing it there
2014-11-30 22:08:52	+Achillion	and he was like
2014-11-30 22:08:55	+Achillion	"errr, you can't do that"
2014-11-30 22:09:00	GI_Jack	I knew the name, because everyone in tech couldn't shut up about it
2014-11-30 22:09:27	GI_Jack	Wow, you can use UNIX on a PC, wow!
2014-11-30 22:11:04	krosos	first time trying gentoo and you forgot to load or print the manual because you couldn't connect to the internet all the time. no good memories
2014-11-30 22:11:39	wasamasa	so, I've tried out today for the first time ever to watch a movie I love and know very well with commentary subs
2014-11-30 22:11:46	wasamasa	since commentary tracks are too distracting
2014-11-30 22:11:50	+Achillion	First time I tried Linux was probably SUSE and it was probably 2002ish
2014-11-30 22:11:54	+Achillion	But that didn't last long
2014-11-30 22:12:08	+Achillion	wasamasa: how was it? Never done it
2014-11-30 22:12:15	krosos	suse was soooo slow on my computer back then
2014-11-30 22:12:43	krosos	commentary tracks are cool :)
2014-11-30 22:12:48	+Achillion	I think I tried again (SUSE again, I believe) when I was at Uni in 2005 or '06, but that didn't stick either
2014-11-30 22:12:51	wasamasa	what I've learned so far is that Who Framed Roger Rabbit turned the entire cast into alcoholics and that unnatural breast movement can be done by subtly inverting the movements (such as making a down bounce an up bounce and vice versa)
2014-11-30 22:12:57	wasamasa	that predates the gainax bounce!
2014-11-30 22:13:01	wasamasa	or does it
2014-11-30 22:13:01	+Achillion	The real change came in 2008, when I had some time off between Master's and PhD
2014-11-30 22:13:03	⚡	wasamasa checks
2014-11-30 22:13:05	+Achillion	and then it was all downhill
2014-11-30 22:13:37	+Achillion	yeah, but Who Framed Roger Rabbit is gold
2014-11-30 22:14:02	wasamasa	damnit, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Gunbuster were both released the same year
2014-11-30 22:14:20	krosos	when was that? it has been ages since i watched it
2014-11-30 22:14:29	wasamasa	both works that very likely redefined the business of making drawn breasts bounce in very alluring ways
2014-11-30 22:14:29	krosos	2000? 1996?
2014-11-30 22:14:35	wasamasa	1988
2014-11-30 22:14:40	krosos	close
2014-11-30 22:14:49	wasamasa	I grew up watching it
2014-11-30 22:15:13	⚡	supergeek800 tried it for the first time in class on Crunchbang a couple years ago, and then first started seriously using it on Ubuntu 12.10. lol
2014-11-30 22:15:31	krosos	i watched it when it was already some years out… because that movie is only one year younger than I am xD
2014-11-30 22:15:36	Lehvyn	WFRR was awesome.
2014-11-30 22:15:39	⚡	supergeek800 Have since moved on though.
2014-11-30 22:16:23	wasamasa	"Perhaps ironically, Gunbuster actually features what can be considered as close to realistic as possible physics for the bouncing breasts. Noriko's bounced so much mainly because she moved around a lot even when she wasn't wearing a bra."
2014-11-30 22:16:28	supergeek800	Basically, as far as how long I've been using it for, four years, I'm the relative newb in this chat.
2014-11-30 22:16:33	wasamasa	hmm
2014-11-30 22:16:40	krosos	everybody is new once
2014-11-30 22:16:42	wasamasa	I'll still let it count
2014-11-30 22:17:50	supergeek800	Hopping path basically went Ubuntu for hald a year > Fedora for three months > Archbang for a year > been on straight Arch for a couple months now.
2014-11-30 22:18:00	supergeek800	*half
2014-11-30 22:18:32	wasamasa	anyhow, there's another movie by that director I have to watch
2014-11-30 22:18:35	wasamasa	Back To The Future
2014-11-30 22:19:02	random-nick	wasamasa: Bact to the Future is awesome
2014-11-30 22:19:19	wasamasa	guess that will eat up another weekend of mine
2014-11-30 22:19:21	krosos	anybody remember Zenwalk? it's relatively unknown these days but i used it a long time and (back then) it followed an KISS philosophy
2014-11-30 22:19:45	supergeek800	Originally wanted to go to Sabayon from Ubuntu, but my hardware basically told me to go fuck myself and wouldn't load the live media.
2014-11-30 22:19:49	+Achillion	wasamasa: is Gunbuster a good series?
2014-11-30 22:20:00	wasamasa	Achillion: I dunno, but I have it on my external

2014-11-30 22:20:46	supergeek800	Kinda glad because it would've been slower and more bloated than either Ubuntu or Fedora was.

2014-11-30 22:22:04	supergeek800	Also, was between Manjaro and Archbang for moving on frm Fedora, but ultimately went for the latter.

2014-11-30 22:23:20	wasamasa	Achillion: my favourite obviously combines it all
2014-11-30 22:23:52	wasamasa	Achillion: and studio gainax has made a considerable number of anime falling in the first category, so I hope for the best

2014-11-30 22:33:07	krosos	there are lots of banks and very expensive stores
2014-11-30 22:33:24	supergeek800	And CEOs and moguls both fall under the 'can afford a Bentley' slot.
2014-11-30 22:33:41	krosos	most people can't afford appartments in those parts of the town

2014-11-30 22:43:32	mankypirate	Roukoswarf: because lennart is evil
2014-11-30 22:43:51	supergeek800	Should be a fix to that in the manual somewhere, like most everything else about Arch.
2014-11-30 22:43:52	Roukoswarf	but everything else works, i just cant seem to set my mtu to 8996
2014-11-30 22:44:00	Roukoswarf	supergeek800: nope
2014-11-30 22:44:22	Roukoswarf	networkd is very sparcely documented, as its main use is for systemd containers
2014-11-30 22:44:29	Roukoswarf	which... arent really ready yet
2014-11-30 22:45:00	supergeek800	The one thing in Arch that's sparsely documented.
2014-11-30 22:45:14	Roukoswarf	everythign else about systemd has great docs
2014-11-30 22:45:27	Roukoswarf	networkd is... very sparce
2014-11-30 22:45:34	@demize	Just containers aren't their main use.
2014-11-30 22:45:45	supergeek800	As for me, I've networkmanager so no issues here.
2014-11-30 22:45:46	@demize	containers, servers, other things with simple networking needs.
2014-11-30 22:45:50	Roukoswarf	network works fine, issue is just setting mtu does nothing, and doesnt error
2014-11-30 22:46:08	Roukoswarf	even with a wildcard link match

2014-11-30 22:47:44	Roukoswarf	but i cant produce any docs on the issue, it just "doesnt work"
2014-11-30 22:47:54	sheep	is it the MTUBytes option in the [NetDev] section?
2014-11-30 22:48:21	Roukoswarf	no, im doing it in a .link wildcarded to match all devices
2014-11-30 22:48:41	Roukoswarf	as it seems to be only configurable in .link

2014-12-01 07:09:06	@grawity	hmm, it seems the passport information can be read only if I scan the serial & expiry-date stuff beforehand

2014-12-01 07:10:26	rabbitear_sdf	The U.S. Passport Card is not supported. It is based on a different RFID technology which is not compatible with NFC. U.S. electronic passports (booklets) are supported, though. Please note that the antenna in the U.S. electronic passport is located on the inside of the back cover. The booklet needs to be opened to access the chip. -- from the second App

2014-12-01 21:16:51	Arch-TK	See, that wouldn't look very good, In the meanwhile, I found a serverfault thread explaining that most of the time anything goes.
2014-12-01 21:16:56	Arch-TK	So I might just put my domain name in there.

2014-12-01 22:26:19	+ornitorrincos	so 5€ for base game plus dlcs
2014-12-01 22:26:36	krosos	it was like 40€ earlier this year i think?
2014-12-01 22:26:45	@halosghost	meh, fuggit, /me signs up for diasp
2014-12-01 22:27:01	+ornitorrincos	I think I saw it for 5€ the base game one or two months after release
2014-12-01 22:27:14	+ornitorrincos	which worries me, that game went down in price very fast
2014-12-01 22:27:47	krosos	hm… but this happens very often now
2014-12-01 22:27:52	+ornitorrincos	although to be honest shadows of mordor has been at 30€ since release if you knew where to look(with regular retailers, no grey key sellers)
2014-12-01 22:28:04	krosos	you can't look at steam for prices
2014-12-01 22:28:10	krosos	their price policy is fucked

2014-12-06 18:53:43	ruan	python would be great
2014-12-06 18:53:50	bougyman	Because of this, error checking in Sorted! is very simple: just count the number of statements; if there are more or less than 14 statements, the program definitely won't work; if it has 14 statements, it will have a very high chance of working (compared to non-14-liners).
2014-12-06 18:54:46	ruan	def underscore underscore init underscore underscore
2014-12-06 18:56:45	bougyman	 Here is a macro, that evaluates the max of two arguments as a function "§".
2014-12-06 18:56:48	bougyman	##:§ ((#0<#1)?#1:#0)
2014-12-06 18:56:49	bougyman	I love this guy
2014-12-06 18:56:51	bougyman	Now you can write §(a,b) everywhere in your code without unsuspecting people knowing what the deal is.

2014-12-07 05:24:39	buhman	otherwise I could give him a vanity id

2014-12-07 05:24:58	buhman	vanity ids for everypony
2014-12-07 05:25:06	polyzen	James_T, like ptpb.pw/poly
2014-12-07 05:25:07	GI_Jack	so whats its deal, is it a true derivative, or is it just an installer
2014-12-07 05:25:11	polyzen	needs more p's, imo
2014-12-07 05:25:11	James_T	oh
2014-12-07 05:25:12	James_T	lol
2014-12-07 05:25:16	GI_Jack	because it'd be great if there was a better installer for arch
2014-12-07 05:25:28	quantum-mechanic	whats wrong with pacman ?
2014-12-07 05:25:29	GI_Jack	like we used to have a curses based installer but no one felt like maintaining it
2014-12-07 05:25:41	GI_Jack	nothing is wrong with pacman
2014-12-07 05:25:45	GI_Jack	I am talking about install medium

2014-12-07 05:25:51	+beest	no one maintained it because it was rubbish and a pain to maintain
2014-12-07 05:25:52	buhman	polyzen: why?

2014-12-07 05:26:01	+beest	the scripts are 1000 times bettar
2014-12-07 05:26:03	polyzen	bueno
2014-12-07 05:26:06	buhman	polyzen: 1) do I care?
2014-12-07 05:26:10	buhman	polyzen: 2) if not they're fucked
2014-12-07 05:26:18	polyzen	^^
2014-12-07 05:27:26	James_T	3) suck buhman's dick
2014-12-07 05:27:36	buhman	optimal conclusion
2014-12-07 05:27:45	quantum-mechanic	hmmm i was googling about llvm IR
2014-12-07 05:27:59	quantum-mechanic	and now im getting ads pointing to github repos on llvm IR
2014-12-07 05:28:03	James_T	lol
2014-12-07 05:28:07	James_T	nice
2014-12-07 05:28:09	+beest	GI_Jack: the install medium /is/ pacman

2014-12-07 05:28:20	James_T	*portage
2014-12-07 05:28:24	GI_Jack	beest, pretty sure its more than that

2014-12-07 05:28:33	James_T	emerge sys-buhman/buhmand
2014-12-07 05:28:41	quantum-mechanic	is it github advertising ?
2014-12-07 05:28:48	quantum-mechanic	or the repoo owner ?
2014-12-07 05:28:58	James_T	dunno

2014-12-07 05:30:39	+beest	partioning, pacstrap, locale scripts, that's pretty much arch installation. partitioning is the bit people seem to get hung up on, and if you can't work out how to partition and fstab at this point, debian is that-a-way

2014-12-07 05:34:15	dradec	partitioning is easy unless you have exotic multi disk schemes
2014-12-07 05:35:43	+beest	i think the problem new users have is the fact that the partitioning options in the wiki guides are kinda laid out in a way that can seem overwhelming but no one wants to touch it
2014-12-07 05:36:17	seoneal97	I've been an idiot when it comes to partioning. I've always booted several distros on this huge hard drive, assigning about 100 GB to each one. Just realized I should have made each partition just large enough for the install and software and had a common data partition
2014-12-07 05:37:14	@halosghost	you know

2014-12-07 05:40:40	+beest	the act of looking for preoccupation in irc seems to be indicative of a deeper problem

2014-12-07 14:29:04	quantum-mechanic	so far what i use pentadactyl for i can pretty much do in vimperator
2014-12-07 14:29:47	quantum-mechanic	vimp looks a little nicer too , but that doesnt matter much 
2014-12-07 14:30:00	quantum-mechanic	i like penta's "loading bar" in the status line
2014-12-07 14:30:27	polyzen	..i want a handheld keyboard, now
2014-12-07 14:30:33	polyzen	for when on the exercise ball
2014-12-07 14:30:59	polyzen	vimp's bar looks worse when i set pixels to 1.5

2014-12-07 15:19:49	MrElendig	15:13 <Blaster> FUCKING everything.  It's a mud pie of permissions and ownership annoyances.  Top that with stupid glareware like app armor and selinux, and it's enough to make me want to throw up all over the place.  Truth is probably 90% of systems are probably using passwordless sudo because of how annoying it is to enter passwords every 31 seconds, which is essentially the same as using a root

2014-12-10 00:50:04	Achillion	I don't know why or how I started this train of introspection and "seriuz bizniz talk". My initial question was rather spontaneous. It's possible I hit that BAC sweet spot where I get all serious and pseudo-"deep". It's been a while since I've found it.
2014-12-10 00:50:55	GermainZ	You kinda asked me to describe myself the way others see me

2014-12-12 23:13:23	+mankypirate	pretty much
2014-12-12 23:13:25	Arch-TK	including "Change administrator password"?
2014-12-12 23:13:32	Arch-TK	What if the computer is linked to a domain?
2014-12-12 23:13:48	+mankypirate	doesn't matter
2014-12-12 23:13:55	+mankypirate	you can change the local admin password
2014-12-12 23:14:15	Arch-TK	Windows adds special preventative measures which (in that case) prevent you from logging into local users and only let you log into the user designated as the local admin user and the domain users
2014-12-12 23:14:20	Arch-TK	right
2014-12-12 23:14:28	Arch-TK	so changing the local admin password still works?
2014-12-12 23:14:30	Arch-TK	fun stuff
2014-12-12 23:14:40	Arch-TK	so in essence: windows is broken?
2014-12-12 23:14:47	+mankypirate	why would it be
2014-12-12 23:14:52	+mankypirate	if you have physical access you have root
2014-12-12 23:15:15	Arch-TK	if you have physical access normally you can still implement certain restrictions surely
2014-12-12 23:15:22	Arch-TK	like setting a bios password
2014-12-12 23:15:30	+mankypirate	if a linux computer is not encrypted you can boot it, go into grub and change the cmdline to telinit=1
2014-12-12 23:15:36	Arch-TK	sure, you can still pull the cmos battery
2014-12-12 23:15:42	+mankypirate	you will get a root shell
2014-12-12 23:15:51	+mankypirate	no password
2014-12-12 23:16:07	Arch-TK	mankypirate: yes, but how do you get into grub without root?

2015-04-05 19:06:03	stardome	if steel beam is on ground with zero load it would laugh at jet fuel. however under heavy load jet fuel does burn hot enough to weaken the structural integrity enough to cause collapse but not true melting

2015-04-05 19:06:52	sheep	even though they all run XP SP3
2015-04-05 19:07:27	sheep	though in this case I need to do a privilege escalation so I can read some protected files
2015-04-05 19:07:45	stardome	XP is a dead waste of time.
2015-04-05 19:08:02	sheep	well, this was for a security class
2015-04-05 19:08:23	sheep	on a related note, bitches don't know 'bout my mysql password security practices
2015-04-05 19:08:30	stardome	given how outdated XP is, I'd say your security class is equally outdated then
2015-04-05 19:09:55	sheep	well, we needed something exploitable for the penetration testing stuff
2015-04-05 19:11:20	sheep	the other half of the systems we have came with ubuntu 8.04
2015-04-05 19:11:28	drfate	sheep: which version
2015-04-05 19:11:30	sheep	so most of us upgraded them to 10.04 or 14.04
2015-04-05 19:11:40	sheep	the XP boxes had SP0
2015-04-05 19:11:47	sheep	but were all upgraded to SP3
2015-04-05 19:11:58	drfate	should still be easy with metasploit
2015-04-05 19:12:12	sheep	each person in the class is responsible for administering an XP box and an Ubuntu box
2015-04-05 19:12:35	drfate	as an aside with phsyical access to a box you can read the drive with a live cd by passing windows passwords 
2015-04-05 19:12:41	sheep	the problem is finding exploits that would work over a network
2015-04-05 19:12:49	sheep	they're all VMs so no physical access
2015-04-05 19:12:59	sheep	the network access for windows is all over VNC
2015-04-05 19:13:15	drfate	if I had a sp3 copy around I'd give it a whirl 
2015-04-05 19:13:27	sheep	all of the systems had a guest account, but the admin accounts were password protected
2015-04-05 19:13:54	sheep	and all but like 4 of the XP boxes had antiviruses running
2015-04-05 19:14:20	sheep	many even blocked using cmd.exe or running untrusted downloads
2015-04-05 19:14:49	drfate	some of the services running by default mind you should be exploitable 
2015-04-05 19:15:10	sheep	most of the ones that would be accessible over a network were firewalled
2015-04-05 19:15:30	sheep	and I specifically need privilege escalation exploits that would let me read arbitrary files
2015-04-05 19:15:46	drfate	netbios is usually not firewalled though I can't think of any exploits off the top of my head 
2015-04-05 19:16:19	sheep	there are a few I tried but they were all patched
2015-04-05 19:16:32	drfate	when in doubt spam it out 
2015-04-05 19:16:44	drfate	some of the exploits might not work on the first try 
2015-04-05 19:16:54	drfate	especially those involving heap overflows 
2015-04-05 19:17:11	drfate	ie malloc/free 
2015-04-05 19:18:01	drfate	when you do get through you want to hide in an innocent looking process like svchost or explorer.exe 
2015-04-05 19:18:30	sheep	I don't need persistent access
2015-04-05 19:19:01	drfate	but if you can get persistent access you should imo 
2015-04-05 19:19:14	sheep	right, but the attack phase of the class ends tomorrow
2015-04-05 19:19:29	sheep	after that it's breach analysis
2015-04-05 19:19:47	drfate	what services are running on the vm's ? 
2015-04-05 19:19:58	drfate	even if they are firewalled I'd like to know 
2015-04-05 19:20:01	sheep	clients just need tightvnc
2015-04-05 19:20:20	sheep	they came with IIS with http, ftp, and smtp enabled, but almost everyone disabled IIS
2015-04-05 19:20:44	sheep	the servers have openssh, apache, phpmyadmin, mysql, and a php webapp running under apache
2015-04-05 19:21:08	drfate	http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/8024/ its from 2009 I believe thats right around when xp support ended 
2015-04-05 19:21:12	sheep	the clients also have a small kiosk interface that queries the database. the webapp is just the admin interface
2015-04-05 19:21:19	sheep	for the kiosk
2015-04-05 19:21:34	sheep	that's just a DoS thing though iirc
2015-04-05 19:21:49	drfate	can you get POST to the apache ? 
2015-04-05 19:21:54	sheep	I don't want to crash the tightvnc server because as part of this project I cannot disable services
2015-04-05 19:21:56	drfate	ie enter data 
2015-04-05 19:22:05	sheep	I can, but I can't upload files to anything
2015-04-05 19:22:37	drfate	don't need to if you can overload the php webapp with bad data you can exploit it 
2015-04-05 19:23:10	sheep	that would really only maybe let me get stuff in the databases
2015-04-05 19:23:26	drfate	depends on who is running the process 
2015-04-05 19:23:33	sheep	which is pointless since only 6 of the 25 people in the class bothered to change the mysql databases' passwords from the defaults
2015-04-05 19:24:21	drfate	if its a seperated account (ie non user/admin) then its not worth the effort, however if its a user and that user is running another exploitable process you should be able to take over another process from there
2015-04-05 19:24:33	sheep	it's running as www-data

2015-08-11 21:23:28	Roukoswarf	yeah, 13 inch 1080
2015-08-11 21:23:35	Roukoswarf	screen is calibrated like shit, but fixable.
2015-08-11 21:23:36	qubitnerd	ive heard good things about this laptop the ux305
2015-08-11 21:23:48	qubitnerd	and its not too pricey too 
2015-08-11 21:23:54	qubitnerd	i think .. dont remember 
2015-08-11 21:23:57	Roukoswarf	ux305 and xps13 are the two nice ones to buy
2015-08-11 21:24:04	Roukoswarf	ux305 is bigger, but thinner and lighter
2015-08-11 21:24:07	Roukoswarf	and lower power
2015-08-11 21:24:10	Roukoswarf	and cheaper
2015-08-11 21:24:31	Roukoswarf	xps13 is thicker, but smaller, and heavier and lasts longer, and stronger, and way more money.
2015-08-11 21:24:52	Roukoswarf	i find the ux305 to be all i need, i have servers to do my processing
2015-08-11 21:25:06	Roukoswarf	speakers on the ux305 though, if you care about speakers, dont buy it.
2015-08-11 21:25:18	Roukoswarf	moderate talking in a room and you cant hear shit from it
2015-08-11 21:25:26	qubitnerd	and the base version of xps13 comes with 4 gigs of ram iirc
2015-08-11 21:25:35	qubitnerd	while ux305 is 8
2015-08-11 21:25:47	Roukoswarf	yeah
2015-08-11 21:25:58	Roukoswarf	xps13 you gotta get the 1200-1400$ models
2015-08-11 21:26:11	Roukoswarf	ssd too small, and ram soldered on at 4gb is pain
2015-08-11 21:26:25	Roukoswarf	ux305 is 256gb ssd and 8gb ram stock
2015-08-11 21:26:58	Roukoswarf	build on both is great
2015-08-11 21:27:40	Roukoswarf	battery on xps13 is like, 2x as big, and hw uses easily 2/3rds more power
2015-08-11 21:27:53	Roukoswarf	so, you gain a couple hours, but have more battery weight.

2015-08-11 21:29:33	qubitnerd	Roukoswarf: and the xps13 has a better cpu too 
2015-08-11 21:29:41	Roukoswarf	i said that.
2015-08-11 21:29:44	Roukoswarf	"stronger"
2015-08-11 21:29:54	Roukoswarf	it eats 2/3rd more power, but has double the battery.
2015-08-11 21:31:23	qubitnerd	the keyboard layout is configurable to have two window keys on either side too nice 
2015-08-11 21:31:42	qubitnerd	keyboard layouts have jsut gotten worse .. i worry 
2015-08-11 21:31:53	Roukoswarf	if you live in somewhere not usa
2015-08-11 21:32:02	Roukoswarf	the xps13 often has a bilingual keyboard
2015-08-11 21:32:12	Roukoswarf	which drives me mental
2015-08-11 21:32:17	qubitnerd	i need two window keys ..

2015-08-12 00:04:32	omanomanooer	 Because the Steam client is a 32-bit application, you will need to enable the multilib repository if you have a 64-bit system. It may also make sense to install multilib-devel to provide some important multilib libraries.

2015-08-12 00:06:16	MrVandelay	woddf2: I used OpenBSD ten years ago, wifi wasn't as widespread or as standard, there was the first wifi implementation and it really sucked. It was slow and relentlessly unreliable. OpenBSD's hardware support was (as far as I noticed) on par with FreeBSD
2015-08-12 00:06:54	MrVandelay	woddf2: Linux had more hardware support but a lot of the cool things in Linux back then were unreliable. Like loadable modules causing kernel panics in a "i have no idea what's going to happen if i load a module" way

2015-08-13 03:35:57	krosos	strange people...
2015-08-13 03:36:57	Max-P	LambdaComplex: I would say Ubuntu probably has a lot more of attention and support for newbies. I would avoid Mint because of the whole "reinstall every 6 months". Maybe Antergos or Manjaro? I always found Fedora to be extremely painful as a distro. Packaging is messy, I don't know if they fixed that.

2015-08-13 03:39:41	escondida	LambdaComplex: Fedora might be good; I haven't looked at it in years. I'd say probably not Ubuntu, if only because they insist on doing everything differently from everybody else, so many things you learn on Ubuntu won't apply to the rest of the Linux world.

2015-08-13 06:54:35	nuun	Then my 98SE installation self-destructed. Here comes BeOS! I could not get sound nor dial-up working with my winmodem and MS dependent SiS chipset; so I was introduced to Mandrake 8.2 by rasta.
2015-08-13 06:55:40	nuun	things were nice until Conexant/Lucent got the big idea to sell the dial-up driver. Luckily, unfortunately, the computer got zapped by JPS.
2015-08-13 06:56:37	nuun	a new computer came shortly through slightly dishonest means. During that age it was NetBSD because pkgsrc was efficient.
2015-08-13 06:58:11	nuun	After a while, it became obvious that I sucked at coding. I did not even know what compiling was. This was 2004. So, I went Slackware and derivatives (Slax, Vector, Zenwalk) for a period of about 6 years.
2015-08-13 06:58:28	nuun	Tried Debian on occasion, but did not understand jigdo.
2015-08-13 06:59:27	nuun	Tried FreeBSD, but was constantly bombarded by bluescreens. (Why did a non-Windows OS use BSOD?)
2015-08-13 07:00:23	nuun	Then I found crux and sourcemage, which instantly lead me to Arch.
2015-08-13 07:00:42	nuun	I just returned from Fedora, by the way.
2015-08-13 07:01:16	cologate	that is a much more impressive and lengthy story than I have leading me to arch
2015-08-13 07:01:30	cologate	but why leave slackware?
2015-08-13 07:01:43	nuun	checkpackage broke.
2015-08-13 07:01:49	nuun	or whatever it was called.
2015-08-13 07:02:07	nuun	and alien made bad packages.
2015-08-13 07:02:47	nuun	cologate: packages in slackware were like Debian, only older and buggy.
2015-08-13 07:02:58	cologate	that's odd, I've heard mostly good things from slack users
2015-08-13 07:03:00	nuun	s/packages/pakaging/
2015-08-13 07:03:07	Roukoswarf	slack is shit
2015-08-13 07:03:09	Roukoswarf	wait
2015-08-13 07:03:13	Roukoswarf	do you mean the distro, or the chat
2015-08-13 07:03:19	cologate	distro
2015-08-13 07:03:21	⚡	Roukoswarf randomly paying attention randomly
2015-08-13 07:03:28	Roukoswarf	oh, slack is nice, the distro
2015-08-13 07:04:16	cologate	I've mostly heard good things about it
2015-08-13 07:04:53	Roukoswarf	it needs to be updated more
2015-08-13 07:04:57	nuun	there was a tool in Slackware that captured the aftermath after your compilation to make a package. It made things easy. But was a bad idea. So, when it went, I left too.

2015-08-13 07:09:17	Roukoswarf	its decent
2015-08-13 07:09:43	nuun	it's aweful.
2015-08-13 07:09:52	nuun	Fedora is for pros.
2015-08-13 07:10:30	nuun	better to suffer the headaches of Rawhide than suffer with the years old bugs under stable.
2015-08-13 07:11:08	nuun	it is not like they are not reported. They seem to get closed or forwarded to new versions often.
2015-08-13 07:11:42	nuun	closed because "can't be bothered to fix."
2015-08-13 07:12:15	cologate	lol, reminds me of the GTK file picker issue the GTK devs haven't acknowledged since like 2002
2015-08-13 07:13:07	Kirito	LambdaComplex, ++Linux Mint

2015-08-13 07:15:21	Hwkiller	Holy shit, these students are such idiots
2015-08-13 07:15:27	Halfwit	I'm sorry.
2015-08-13 07:15:42	Hwkiller	I'm a TA for a learning/behavior lab, they just took their final, and they are fucking miserable people
2015-08-13 07:15:43	Halfwit	They are misinformed on how to properly be informed, is what you mean to say.
2015-08-13 07:15:55	Hwkiller	They are dumbasses
2015-08-13 07:16:32	Hwkiller	they spent a week on "blocking" in lecture and in lab. They conducted an experiment that demonstrated blocking. They were asked questions about blocking. And on the final? They didn't know shit about blocking
2015-08-13 07:16:34	Hwkiller	how?
2015-08-13 07:16:52	cologate	cheated throughout?
2015-08-13 07:16:58	Hwkiller	I dunno; maybe?
2015-08-13 07:17:11	Hwkiller	but cheating from who?
2015-08-13 07:17:18	Hwkiller	literally, the highest grade on the exam was a 79
2015-08-13 07:17:21	Hwkiller	the rest were in the 60s
2015-08-13 07:17:21	cologate	and I've seen a couple people that get really bad test anxiety, and does great on the homework, but just awful on the test
2015-08-13 07:17:27	Halfwit	Whom *
2015-08-13 07:17:41	Max-P	But a whole class?
2015-08-13 07:17:44	Roukoswarf	Hwkiller: in my program, the average person learned windows server (kinda), and cisco stuff
2015-08-13 07:17:52	Roukoswarf	they revolted when taught C++
2015-08-13 07:17:54	Hwkiller	My section is a section of 6, and it's a summer section.
2015-08-13 07:18:06	cologate	a whole class doesn't make much sense, though
2015-08-13 07:18:08	Roukoswarf	"why do we need to learn C++ in networking?"
2015-08-13 07:18:31	Hwkiller	cologate: they are summer students who had to take the class to make up for failed credits otherwise
2015-08-13 07:18:34	Hwkiller	so, yeah it makes sense
2015-08-13 07:18:41	Hwkiller	these aren't the proactive student trying to get ahead
2015-08-13 07:18:51	cologate	oh, that makes sense then
2015-08-13 07:18:56	bkc_	Roukoswarf: why _do_ you have to learn C++ in networking? (I have a few ideas, but not sure :) )
2015-08-13 07:19:14	Roukoswarf	because youre going into IT
2015-08-13 07:19:32	Roukoswarf	and IT people who can just configure cisco shittastic crap, dont get jobs.
2015-08-13 07:19:38	Roukoswarf	they learned no scripting
2015-08-13 07:19:43	Roukoswarf	no system admin
2015-08-13 07:19:45	Roukoswarf	nothing.
2015-08-13 07:19:56	bkc_	well... c++... :/
2015-08-13 07:19:58	cologate	not even shell or something?

2015-08-13 07:20:22	Halfwit	I also hate, "Learn $framework, learn $language". That doesn't prepare them for the post $framework, $language that has been so inevitable in tech
2015-08-13 07:20:51	Roukoswarf	you need to be good enough to learn $framework in a short timeframe and be useful

2015-08-13 08:17:23	LambdaComplex	<tripped> random question: when I install updates using update manager, why is it that I have to answer like fifteen Y/n prompts and enter my password like three times? XD
2015-08-13 08:17:40	LambdaComplex	And here we have a Manjaro user who doesn't even understand that normal packages and AUR packages are fundamentally different

2015-08-13 08:26:35	hekel	<llinguini> Also, unlike the Archwiki, the Manjaro wiki recommends you not do anythign to the pkgbuild if you don't know what you're doing

2015-08-13 08:27:07	AC`97	what was the aur package that had a "rm -rf" to an important system directory?

2015-08-13 08:28:10	hekel	LambdaComplex, is it true that if you're a Manjaro user everything you do and say is better than anything that has anything at all to to with Arch or Arch users because they're all trying to sabotage you?

2015-08-13 08:40:04	LambdaComplex	And the fact that you don't have to install through CLI means that an Antergos user doesn't necessarily know enough about Linux to really be capable of using Arch

2015-08-13 09:13:35	nuun	funny how qemu and bochs been doing this for decades with bare essentials.

2015-08-13 09:14:21	bkc_	big backed projects don't have to outperform... they just need to support ;)

2015-08-13 09:18:30	LambdaComplex	So, IIRC the main selling point of Elementary was its DE...it looks like GNOME to me.

2015-08-13 09:19:51	Hwkiller	no

2015-08-13 14:02:23	mar77i	you killed a cactus? as in, you were less caring than the desert?

2015-08-13 14:03:34	dunz0r	Not even I have managed to kill a cactus
2015-08-13 14:06:23	krosos	it all worked out these years, changed earth, cared for it when things needed to be cut, but i think one time it got too much water.. or change of water (location)...

2015-08-13 22:41:43	h80s	oh k. stick to i3 then
2015-08-13 22:41:50	h80s	i3 is honestly pretty great
2015-08-13 22:42:09	Hwkiller	it doesn't work well with steam, imo.
2015-08-13 22:42:15	h80s	I thought I was in the minority of liking it. Still trying things out.
2015-08-13 22:42:18	Hwkiller	and some games freak out when using it

2015-08-13 22:43:35	Hwkiller	'waste' time?
2015-08-13 22:43:40	Hwkiller	sometimes people like to be entertained

2015-08-14 02:19:05	dunz0r	I wanted to buy Siri Karlsson - Gran Fuego, but they couldn't sell it via bandcamp because they didn't own the rights
2015-08-14 02:19:20	dunz0r	wasamasa: So use your debit/credit card?
2015-08-14 02:19:29	bkc_	wasamasa: _usually_ is, sometimes you're allowed to distribute but not take money for it...
2015-08-14 02:19:36	dunz0r	So now I have to buy the CD :(

2015-08-14 02:39:02	ryaxnb	it's faster to install, but removes the ability to configure as easily by building from source.
2015-08-14 02:39:11	ryaxnb	it is supported by the distros official package tool
2015-08-14 02:39:12	bkc_	dunz0r: they didn't have that when I tried it ^.^
2015-08-14 02:39:13	ryaxnb	whereas the AUR is not
2015-08-14 02:39:25	ryaxnb	but it cannot be configured substantially
2015-08-14 02:39:36	mar77i	ryaxnb: that's where the arch build system comes in, it's pretty neat.
2015-08-14 02:39:37	dunz0r	bkc_: They do now, but I like Resrobot for looking for routes, I just use the UL app to buy tickets
2015-08-14 02:39:39	ryaxnb	and doesn't tend to include variants of existing packages recompiled with or without dependencies.

2015-08-14 02:39:58	ryaxnb	arch has a lot of advantages, and stuff, but if you just want a rolling release without that
2015-08-14 02:39:59	dunz0r	The Resrobot app is unfortunately also ugly
2015-08-14 02:40:06	ryaxnb	i'd say suse is the go-to for that.
2015-08-14 02:40:18	mankypirate	krosos: yeah that doesn't exist here
2015-08-14 02:40:20	ryaxnb	it's rolling release is traditional in every way except it's never versioned.
2015-08-14 02:40:39	ryaxnb	so for newbs who only want arch "because rolling" and don't care about the power (and complexity) of the design
2015-08-14 02:40:45	ryaxnb	and thus might be encouraged to use yaourt or whatever
2015-08-14 02:40:49	mar77i	ryaxnb: ... variants are a lot of work for the two people who will actually run the other
2015-08-14 02:41:02	ryaxnb	mar77i: AUR has a lot of them, IME.
2015-08-14 02:41:20	dunz0r	I don't understand why no one can't just follow design guidelines... aaah
2015-08-14 02:41:27	ryaxnb	of course, making a variant in AUR is pretty easy relative to compiling a variant each time a source changes upstream
2015-08-14 02:41:37	ryaxnb	which is what a suse variant would have to do

2015-08-14 02:42:01	bkc_	(which it couldn't)
2015-08-14 02:42:08	mar77i	yeah, you shouldn't be using arch without being ready to write a pkgbuild, config files and run system administration like cleaning *.pacnew after you, so that's fine with me
2015-08-14 02:42:26	dunz0r	bkc_: In Resrobot you can skip trains/buses/ferries
2015-08-14 02:42:29	ryaxnb	i'm just thinking that arch seems to have gotten a lot of new users who primarily came because they wanted rolling and didn't want to bother with arch itself
2015-08-14 02:42:40	bkc_	dunz0r: but not the UL-app? (which the old one could btw)
2015-08-14 02:42:42	ryaxnb	it seems like suse would be a good redirect for those users.
2015-08-14 02:42:46	ryaxnb	who don't really want arch
2015-08-14 02:42:51	ryaxnb	they just want a rolling distro

2015-08-14 02:43:06	mar77i	ryaxnb: arch isn't that much about the users. those who don't like it will ditch it - and will be told, too.

2015-08-14 02:43:20	ryaxnb	mar77i: of course, but it helps to suggest an alternative.

2015-08-14 02:43:35	mar77i	you can't tell others what to do
2015-08-14 02:43:36	ryaxnb	suse so far is the only rolling distro i've found that would fit that userbase.
2015-08-14 02:43:56	ryaxnb	arch fits the arch base.

2015-08-14 02:44:37	ryaxnb	mmmm
2015-08-14 02:44:56	ryaxnb	well for me, i normally run arch when i want to fiddle with the latest DE that just came off the burner
2015-08-14 02:45:02	ryaxnb	because few other distros can do that
2015-08-14 02:45:15	ryaxnb	that means it's not my primary distro, but it's without caliber at that sort of thing
2015-08-14 02:45:35	mar77i	ryaxnb: arch would have to ask money from suse to recommend it (I'd love to earn something to tell people to fuck off and buy rhel)
2015-08-14 02:45:47	ryaxnb	rhel lol

2015-08-14 02:48:36	ryaxnb	i think it focuses on the Old Enterprise vision of "enterprise = supported for 10 years"
2015-08-14 02:48:44	ryaxnb	that's rapidly changing in all but the most stubborn enterprises.
2015-08-14 02:48:50	ryaxnb	the biggest, baddest, and slowest-to-move ones
2015-08-14 02:48:55	mar77i	sure but they also build their stuff and... wait extensibly, busy with counting money. you can't run a business if you're not counting money.

2015-08-14 02:49:43	ryaxnb	and MS will be pushing that on every enterprise that can do that (everything but the fortune 1000)

2015-08-14 02:50:38	ryaxnb	it's one thing to have a product supported for 10 years, but red hat dosn't offer a product that's updated regularly at all
2015-08-14 02:50:52	ryaxnb	they only release new major versions every 5 years or so, less oftne than even MS
2015-08-14 02:51:03	ryaxnb	it's just not kosher.
2015-08-14 02:52:05	mar77i	yeah, I think m$ is fixing their viruses issue once and for all by integrating the spyware directly into the kernel. it's just an amazing idea to make money off users' data like everyone else does. but monies still need counting, so guess when they're done couning teh monies, no they won't stahp!

2015-08-14 04:04:28	dexter	Bro I marinate my steaks in antifreeze.
2015-08-14 04:04:52	bkc_	woddf2: "partial enteral nutrition" ?

2015-08-14 04:05:16	bkc_	"partial parenteral nutrition" *
2015-08-14 04:05:52	dexter	I like spitting into gatorade bottles. I can hit it from like 6 feet up. I could turn this into a sport.
2015-08-14 04:06:03	dexter	"More fun than golf, spit yer dip as far as ye can!"
2015-08-14 04:06:46	dexter	and then we'd have extremists flying out of planes spitting into cheerio sized spots on the ground 6000 feet down.
2015-08-14 04:06:47	bkc_	"first one to fill it up wins!"
2015-08-14 04:06:48	bkc_	:P
2015-08-14 04:07:13	dexter	I currently have a 3/4 full gatorade bottle. It's actually pretty disgusting.
2015-08-14 04:07:25	bkc_	you chew tabacco?
2015-08-14 04:07:27	dexter	Smells like a mixture of wintergreen, mint and ass.
2015-08-14 04:07:32	dexter	I dip tobacco, I don't chew.
2015-08-14 04:07:39	bkc_	dafuq is dip?
2015-08-14 04:07:43	dexter	snuff
2015-08-14 04:07:50	bkc_	oh...
2015-08-14 04:07:55	bkc_	just call it snus ffs -.-
2015-08-14 04:08:02	dexter	fine cut tobacco you put in your lip. If you chew it you're gonna have a bad time.
2015-08-14 04:08:03	dexter	also no
2015-08-14 04:08:06	dexter	snus is not snuff
2015-08-14 04:08:35	dexter	there's longcut and widecut snuff too so those are cool
2015-08-14 04:09:15	⚡	dexter gently sits the gatorade bottle in bkc's trunk, closes the lid and walks away whistling.

2015-08-14 04:09:41	bkc_	dafuq... "nasal snuff"... people actually put snuff in their nose? o.O
2015-08-14 04:09:57	bkc_	Kirito: hehe
2015-08-14 04:10:00	dexter	you put it in the cup between your wrist bone and hand and sniff it
2015-08-14 04:10:21	dexter	it's a really really fine powder. And you don't snort lines like coke.
2015-08-14 04:10:27	dexter	Again, a bad time.
2015-08-14 04:11:23	bkc_	http://muslimsocialservicesagency.org/wp-content/themes/copenhagen-snuff-cans-i9.jpg <-- that sure as hell looks like snus :/

2015-08-14 04:12:14	bkc_	also, wanna bet? since I have like 5 of those in my fridge :)

2015-08-14 04:12:59	dexter	bkc_: so you dip?
2015-08-14 04:13:22	dexter	have you seen the grizzly 6 in one cans? 6 cans worth of dip packed into one big ass can
2015-08-14 04:13:59	bkc_	apparently not
2015-08-14 04:14:06	bkc_	"However snus, snuff, and dipping tobacco are distinct products."
2015-08-14 04:14:09	bkc_	I snus :P
2015-08-14 04:14:14	dexter	like you'd have to wear overalls to carry it
2015-08-14 04:14:34	dexter	bkc_: get you a can of grizzly wintergreen long cut.
2015-08-14 04:14:53	dexter	it's like $2 and if you don't like it send the rest to me
2015-08-14 04:14:58	bkc_	"Scandinavian snus is a moist form of smokeless tobacco which is usually placed under the upper lip, and which does not result in the need for spitting. It is sold either as a moist powder known as loose snus, or prepackaged into pouches known as portion snus. Snus is often mildly flavored with smoke, bergamot, citrus, juniper berry, herbs and/or floral flavors."
2015-08-14 04:15:25	bkc_	shipping is most likely >$2 :P
2015-08-14 04:15:26	dexter	You know what they call guys that use pouches?
2015-08-14 04:15:32	bkc_	babies? :)

2015-08-14 04:16:14	dexter	I tried them once because it was all the corner store had.
2015-08-14 04:16:21	dexter	Didn't care for it.
2015-08-14 04:17:01	dexter	They're not very durable, and the tobacco inside of them is really really fine cut, so when my teeth inevitably rips one open I get a mess in my mouth
2015-08-14 04:17:08	dexter	:(
2015-08-14 04:17:37	bkc_	I can have mine in while sleeping... :/

2015-08-15 07:08:24	dexter	I hear spring buckling keyboards are even louder

2015-08-15 15:38:38	MrElendig	:p
2015-08-15 15:39:01	faiden	well.. the armv7 is using x64
2015-08-15 15:39:20	faiden	so If I want full performance I need to do a little bit more
2015-08-15 15:44:11	dagle	armv7 is using x64? O_o
2015-08-15 15:44:19	dagle	What does that even mean?
2015-08-15 15:44:34	MrElendig	faiden: no
2015-08-15 15:44:49	MrElendig	faiden: 64bit != x64
2015-08-15 15:45:06	faiden	well armv6 is using 1 core armv7 using 4cores
2015-08-15 15:45:32	dagle	4 cores isn't equal to x64... don't see how it would be.
2015-08-15 15:45:58	dagle	Also, x64 doesn't really exist.
2015-08-15 15:46:14	MrElendig	how many cores you have is not related to the architecture
2015-08-15 15:46:38	MrElendig	x64 == what microsoft etc calls x86_64/amd64
2015-08-15 15:46:45	faiden	Ok but I checked a few guides and swaping the card would not give you the full performance as they are using a difference architecture
2015-08-15 15:47:01	MrElendig	also rpi2 is not 64bit anyway
2015-08-15 15:47:23	MrElendig	rpi2 == rpi1 with a fpu
2015-08-15 15:47:27	MrElendig	basicly
2015-08-15 15:47:32	dagle	Well, you would need to update /boot
2015-08-15 15:47:44	dagle	And some pacman / makepkg settings.
2015-08-15 15:47:48	dagle	And maybe some more.
2015-08-15 15:48:02	dagle	And then reinstall every package you have installed.
2015-08-15 15:48:02	MrElendig	also new and better chips that you can crash using a flashlight!
2015-08-15 15:48:06	dagle	So not worth it.
2015-08-15 15:49:31	faiden	I got mine in a case so the flashlight is no biggie. Still just swapping the SD card is not possible
2015-08-15 15:49:58	MrElendig	faiden: depending on what image you use you only have to move the sd card
2015-08-15 15:50:10	MrElendig	and it will just work(tm)
2015-08-15 15:50:22	dagle	Depends on what SD card too.
2015-08-15 15:50:23	MrElendig	but ofcourse you have not said what you are running on it so...
2015-08-15 15:50:24	MrElendig	:D

2015-08-16 03:38:06	dexter	bkc_: if you're in the front seats.
2015-08-16 03:38:11	bkc_	TIL
2015-08-16 03:38:27	bkc_	I thought that 'Murica was the land of "who boddy cares" :P
2015-08-16 03:38:30	bkc_	bloddy*
2015-08-16 03:38:38	LambdaComplex	No, 'Murica is the land of "get us more money"
2015-08-16 03:38:44	dexter	But if you're on a two wheeled death machine (motorcycle), you don't have to wear a helmet because after 2 years of riding your head is immune to being smashed against the pavement
2015-08-16 03:38:44	bkc_	ooh right...
2015-08-16 03:38:47	LambdaComplex	So, more excuses to give tickets = more money for the police force
2015-08-16 03:38:52	bkc_	dexter: xD
2015-08-16 03:39:04	LambdaComplex	dexter: Pretty sure there's a helmet law in NC
2015-08-16 03:39:26	dexter	In MI you can ride without a helmet two years after you get your endorsement and pass an msf course
2015-08-16 03:39:37	bkc_	LambdaComplex: or people riding motorcycles are just smarter than the average car driver :P
2015-08-16 03:40:10	bkc_	why would anyone wanna ride a MC w/o a helmet? o.O
2015-08-16 03:40:22	dexter	because helmets are just going to snap your neck anyways
2015-08-16 03:40:24	bkc_	is frikkin' suecide...
2015-08-16 03:40:34	dexter	you can either choose between a broken neck or a broken head
2015-08-16 03:40:37	bkc_	nah, wear a neck-brace
2015-08-16 03:40:48	bkc_	10/10 would broken neck
2015-08-16 03:41:05	dexter	Anyone that thinks a helmet is going to save their life going down the freeway at 70+mph is insane
2015-08-16 03:41:17	bkc_	indeed

2015-08-16 03:41:50	Halfwit	Stupid fucks taxing the medical systems.
2015-08-16 03:41:58	dexter	The only time a helmet is useful is when you're in towns, and if you find yourself needing head protection going 25mph you probably don't need a motorcycle.
2015-08-16 03:42:01	dexter	Halfwit: wat
2015-08-16 03:42:07	dexter	the legal limit on the freeway is 70mph
2015-08-16 03:42:15	Halfwit	Shouldn't be, but whatever.
2015-08-16 03:42:18	bkc_	Halfwit: what medical system? either they get a bruise (spelling) or they die.. 
2015-08-16 03:42:23	dexter	Are you one of those dillholes that goes 45mph on the freeway because that's the legal minimum?
2015-08-16 03:42:31	Halfwit	No. 
2015-08-16 03:42:49	dexter	why should the freeway not be 70mph

2015-08-16 03:42:53	bkc_	ooh right... 'Murica has 'legal minimum' :D
2015-08-16 03:42:59	Halfwit	They shouldn't be on the freeway at all.
2015-08-16 03:43:03	bkc_	Halfwit: kill the veggies...
2015-08-16 03:43:05	dexter	what
2015-08-16 03:43:15	Halfwit	It's an inherently unsafe endeavour.
2015-08-16 03:43:19	Halfwit	That it's allowed is silly.
2015-08-16 03:43:23	dexter	motorcycles are inherently unsafe
2015-08-16 03:43:33	bkc_	Halfwit: freeway is pretty much where you wanna be with a MC
2015-08-16 03:43:38	dexter	you're going from a cage on 4 wheels to basically riding a fucking broomstick on 2
2015-08-16 03:44:09	krosos	stupid router with stupid openwrt and new ipv6 settings and dnscrypt-proxy and meh all just meh.. need to retry this when I have more time than "oops, internet gone"

2015-08-16 03:44:25	dexter	if you wanna dance butt ass naked in the middle of i-75, go for it. I don't care.
2015-08-16 03:44:28	Halfwit	Yeah, clearly why I stated that they, on an interstate, is a bad idea. For the aforementioned strain it puts on others.
2015-08-16 03:44:28	dexter	o_O
2015-08-16 03:44:29	bkc_	krosos: never fuck around with the old router you have :P
2015-08-16 03:44:52	dexter	how does it put strain on other people?

2015-08-16 03:44:57	dexter	gtfo
2015-08-16 03:45:05	mankypirate	motorcycles aren't really unsafe as such

2015-08-16 03:45:15	bkc_	what mankypirate said...
2015-08-16 03:45:19	bkc_	just don't crash ;)
2015-08-16 03:45:22	Halfwit	Jesus. 
2015-08-16 03:45:31	dexter	Yes?
2015-08-16 03:45:34	Halfwit	You're all part of the problem.
2015-08-16 03:45:39	dexter	no, you are
2015-08-16 03:45:51	dexter	cars put strain on semi truck drivers so they shouldn't be allowed on the freeway
2015-08-16 03:45:51	Halfwit	How?
2015-08-16 03:45:54	bkc_	this is why I don't wanna get a driverslicense for MC... I'd kill myself within a month...
2015-08-16 03:45:58	Halfwit	No, they shouldn't
2015-08-16 03:46:00	dexter	and cars are incredibly unsafe, have you seen what happens when a semi runs over them?
2015-08-16 03:46:02	Halfwit	I agree with that.
2015-08-16 03:46:18	Halfwit	Humans shouldn't drive anything
2015-08-16 03:46:23	dexter	I can't decide if you're trolling me or just dum :(
2015-08-16 03:46:27	Halfwit	We're pathetic apes compared to other options
2015-08-16 03:46:31	dexter	racist
2015-08-16 03:46:35	bkc_	Halfwit: +1... no humans behind the wheels :D
2015-08-16 03:46:50	krosos	bkc_: dnscrypt with ip4 worked. than i added the wish to use ipv6 and it got difficult because 1&1 sucks and my router setup is not that easy. i only have the saturday every week to play and break configurations which are outside the routers in my room.
2015-08-16 03:47:07	Halfwit	There's no such thing as race. Just divergent traits through subtle evolution.
2015-08-16 03:47:12	bkc_	dexter: how can you be racist against your own kind? :/
2015-08-16 03:47:25	dexter	bkc_: are you saying halfwit is an ape
2015-08-16 03:47:30	bkc_	Halfwit: and that is the definition of race, kthxbye
2015-08-16 03:47:35	dexter	Halfwit: get your stinkin paws off me you damn dirty ape
2015-08-16 03:47:46	Halfwit	bkc_: No, they have since removed the classification. 
2015-08-16 03:47:53	bkc_	dexter: he said "we're", which includes himself...
2015-08-16 03:47:55	Halfwit	bkc_: There's no proper distinction

2015-08-16 03:48:11	mankypirate	makes little sense in this climate though
2015-08-16 03:48:24	mankypirate	better to just have a car

2015-08-16 03:49:04	dexter	Halfwit: get mad baddy
2015-08-16 03:49:25	dexter	bkc_: I dropped my bike only one time, and it was because I was dumb and cut too sharp.
2015-08-16 03:49:46	dexter	I was going under 5mph, so I just turned it off, picked it up, turned it back on and road off into the sunset.
2015-08-16 03:49:47	bkc_	hehe, I have no clue how many times I've crashed ^.^
2015-08-16 03:50:15	dexter	Going fast on a bike is easy. Low speed maneuvering is the hard part.

2015-08-16 03:51:54	bkc_	BURNOUt!!!! :D
2015-08-16 03:52:01	Halfwit	I think it'd be a pretty decent compromise to have bike-only lanes, or bike-only highways for that matter
2015-08-16 03:52:02	dexter	That's why you don't ride in the center of a lane.
2015-08-16 03:52:11	bkc_	+1 dexter
2015-08-16 03:52:33	dexter	I think it'd be a pretty decent compromise to have halfwit-only internets

2015-08-16 03:52:44	bkc_	Halfwit: IMO bike/car/semi-only separation would be nice :)
2015-08-16 03:53:00	dexter	bkc_: motorcycle and bicycle need separation too
2015-08-16 03:53:10	dexter	because I wanna ride my bicycle down i-75 all the way to florida
2015-08-16 03:53:19	bkc_	dexter: ibviously... but then again, we already have than here in Schweden :D
2015-08-16 03:53:25	Halfwit	dexter: You cry that no one likes you, then you go and just be a general douche. What the fuck man, I'm gonna have to call your family and arrange an intervention.

2015-08-16 03:56:53	Halfwit	I don't do that when I'm drunk, just when I'm not
2015-08-16 03:57:00	bkc_	as in, I still know I shouldn't, I normally suppress it, but I become more aware of the fact that I'm thinking it...
2015-08-16 03:57:27	bkc_	and I usually quit drinking before I say something stupid

2015-08-16 07:22:49	Halfwit	It's really sad. Commercialization has really eroded the beauty that was the music industry
2015-08-16 07:23:10	Halfwit	And now you get this vapid shit that makes, at least me, actually angry while listening to it.

2015-08-16 07:23:47	LambdaComplex	The music industry has always been about commercialization 
2015-08-16 07:24:20	Halfwit	I retract the bit about beauty, too.
2015-08-16 07:24:40	LambdaComplex	Bands writing their own music has pretty much never been the norm 
2015-08-16 07:24:49	LambdaComplex	Gotta have professional songwriters do all the writing so we can make the most money
2015-08-16 07:25:08	Halfwit	:D
2015-08-16 07:27:10	Halfwit	It's that the stuff that is being lauded as of the highest quality clearly is not. It's so transparent to anyone who has heard/made music. 
2015-08-16 07:27:38	Halfwit	That's what I blame the music industry for doing.  Championing the shit that should have just been a passing fancy. 
2015-08-16 07:30:14	LambdaComplex	I should probably try to find some decent quality modern stuff

2015-08-16 07:37:32	Halfwit	The rest I've only heard a few songs from Rhapsody of Fire.

2015-08-16 07:40:08	LambdaComplex	So I noticed :P
2015-08-16 07:40:28	Halfwit	But like I said, it has some intelligence, and quite a lot of socially driven lyrical content.

2015-08-16 07:41:35	nixnerd	About as hard as I go is Baroness Yellow and Green album
2015-08-16 07:41:42	Halfwit	It plays to my deeply angry passionate side, while still maintaining some beauty.
2015-08-16 07:42:27	LambdaComplex	Great White is <3
2015-08-16 07:42:56	LambdaComplex	Oh, and I like Jethro Tull too. Might like Blackfoot. Highway Song and Train, Train are good, at least.

2015-08-16 07:47:10	Halfwit	Yeah that's slow :p
2015-08-16 07:48:15	Halfwit	It compliments the message well though.

2015-08-16 07:49:18	Halfwit	That's so important to really present any sort of emotion in the story you want to tell, have the music be an extension of that.

2015-08-16 07:52:26	LambdaComplex	It'd be 6 but my A is in my bedroom

2015-08-16 07:57:50	dexter	I'm guessing you linked iron man
2015-08-16 07:58:13	dexter	I actually haven't listened to Sabbath in a while, so I don't recall what my favorite song was. I know I liked paranoid.
2015-08-16 07:58:51	LambdaComplex	dexter: I would do no such thing!
2015-08-16 07:59:02	LambdaComplex	I said "their favorite," not "the most overated"
2015-08-16 07:59:27	dexter	overrate is underkill

2015-08-16 07:59:59	dexter	for whatever reason youtube is actually not loading
2015-08-16 08:00:01	Halfwit	I'm inclined to lean towards Black Sabbath, heh.
2015-08-16 08:00:02	LambdaComplex	it's scarlet pimpernel from the eternal idol 
2015-08-16 08:00:03	Halfwit	But I like a lot
2015-08-16 08:00:18	LambdaComplex	Mine is probably Solitude. Great song. Fun to play.
2015-08-16 08:00:46	dexter	I have a guitar. I don't know how to play it, but I have one.

2015-08-16 08:01:46	Halfwit	Seriously though, this cover is so good.
2015-08-16 08:02:03	LambdaComplex	Been a while since I listened to it. Listening now!
2015-08-16 08:02:27	LambdaComplex	Not as good as the original. Sounds too good. As in, the recording quality is literally too good. Doesn't sound creepy enough. Just not the same.
2015-08-16 08:02:30	Halfwit	Especially the breakdown bit. (slow getting in to, but)

2015-08-16 08:03:51	LambdaComplex	Seriously, thanks to this, I hate listening to War Pigs
2015-08-16 08:03:57	LambdaComplex	Because I can't hear Geezer well enough
2015-08-16 08:04:23	Halfwit	Have you heard Iced Earth's Alive In Athens stuff?
2015-08-16 08:05:22	LambdaComplex	Probably not
2015-08-16 08:05:31	Halfwit	Just live stuff
2015-08-16 08:05:35	Halfwit	it's rather good though.

2015-08-16 09:05:23	gaston1	The dilemma, study for my exams or install dwarf fortress
2015-08-16 09:06:20	escondida	The history of the world is an increasingly-complex (starting from a baseline of *extremely* complex) web of individual creatures engaged in events. There'll be tens of thousands of named people (and monsters) who've lived out their lives by the time you start playing
2015-08-16 09:06:42	escondida	gaston1: Exams first, then DF (-:
2015-08-16 09:07:18	gaston1	escondida: Yes ofc, so then it will be social life or DF

2015-08-16 09:07:44	polyzen	my social life has been non-existant these past couple of weeks

2015-08-16 09:08:26	polyzen	basically the same ui?
2015-08-16 09:08:27	escondida	gaston1: Some. I studied it a few years ago. You're a rarity around here; most people assume I got it from the Portuguese
2015-08-16 09:08:42	escondida	polyzen: Very different. They're both text-based, but that's as far as the similarity runs
2015-08-16 09:08:50	polyzen	i see
2015-08-16 09:09:42	escondida	polyzen: So basically, nethack is a carefully-balanced dungeon crawler in which the interactions between any given set of creatures and/or items has been carefully planned out
2015-08-16 09:09:54	gaston1	escondida: Its hard to find a chatroom/forum that doesent call you "taco language" for speaking spanish, when its one of the most spoken languages in the world :c

2015-08-16 17:50:38	wasamasa	like, when you use emacs --batch and run some elisp that assumes syntax highlighting is on, guess what
2015-08-16 17:50:43	wasamasa	syntax highlighting isn't on
2015-08-16 17:50:55	wasamasa	because it disables itself when detecting emacs is run in batch mode
2015-08-16 17:51:04	tigrmesh	ahh
2015-08-16 17:51:31	wasamasa	it shows in other places as well, like commandline argument handling, input-output, the required shebang, etc.
2015-08-16 17:51:38	wasamasa	so I've given up on that
2015-08-16 17:52:22	tigrmesh	what are you doing that you want to do syntax highlighting in batch?
2015-08-16 17:52:26	wasamasa	a static blog
2015-08-16 17:54:02	tigrmesh	you publish directly from org?

2015-08-16 17:57:53	tigrmesh	2 versions?
2015-08-16 17:58:01	wasamasa	well, hyde usually refers to the ruby project
2015-08-16 17:58:07	wasamasa	there's also a python project with the same name
2015-08-16 17:59:05	tigrmesh	so chicken's hyde is the site generator

2015-08-16 17:59:21	tigrmesh	haha
2015-08-16 17:59:48	tigrmesh	so chicken's hyde is lisp/scheme or similar?
2015-08-16 18:00:00	wasamasa	it's chicken scheme
2015-08-16 18:00:13	tigrmesh	gotcha
2015-08-16 18:00:37	tigrmesh	what is it's strength?
2015-08-16 18:01:17	wasamasa	it compiles to C
2015-08-16 18:01:45	wasamasa	this gives me a high-level language that can easily go down low-level and interact with other software written in and for C
2015-08-16 18:02:00	tigrmesh	like what?
2015-08-16 18:02:21	wasamasa	C libraries and C tooling
2015-08-16 18:02:40	tigrmesh	what's its weakness?
2015-08-16 18:03:13	wasamasa	the community is rather small, so you're likelier to get involved with fixing up stuff

2015-08-19 21:53:07	MrVandelay	diegoviola: Our entire universe could exist within the equivalent of a rain drop in a four-dimensional world for all we know
2015-08-19 21:53:36	MrVandelay	just as colonies of bacteria exist in your unwashed dishes
2015-08-19 21:54:15	MrVandelay	and what we perceive as billions of years passing could be a second before that rain drop hits the proverbial ground
2015-08-19 21:54:20	MrVandelay	We simply have no idea, at all.

2015-08-19 21:55:22	MrVandelay	It feeds into the insane monkey theorem

2015-08-19 21:55:41	diegoviola	some philosophers have argued years about many things and we eventually knew about the Sun, the Earth, etc, do you guys think we might eventually find this out too?
2015-08-19 21:55:43	MrVandelay	if you put a bunch of monkeys into a room with typewriters typing away eventually by random chance they will produce the collected works of shakespeare
2015-08-19 21:56:20	houn	Maybe.  It is certainly a mathematical possibility.
2015-08-19 21:56:37	MrVandelay	Our universe has existed for -very long- time in comparison to our civilization
2015-08-19 21:56:44	houn	But it's an insanely low probability.

2015-08-19 21:56:56	MrVandelay	the probability is 100% given enough time

2015-08-19 21:57:40	MrVandelay	If you stand at the half way line and you throw one ball at the hoop
2015-08-19 21:57:46	MrVandelay	The likelihood of you missing is high
2015-08-19 21:58:03	MrVandelay	But if you're allowed to stand there forever and take the same shot the likelihood of you hitting rises
2015-08-19 21:58:35	houn	Assuming that methodology, if you were to "brute force" the sequence of events and evolutions from "Big Bang" to "Us Having This Conversation on IRC", and that combination was the LAST ONE in the full set of possible combinations, how long do you think you'd need to complete that?
2015-08-19 21:58:37	MrVandelay	our universe has been hitting it for a very long time before our civilization happened
2015-08-19 21:59:05	MrVandelay	houn: Well first off, we don't really believe that the big bang is what happened
2015-08-19 21:59:31	MrVandelay	But putting that aside, it would take a long time to complete that. That's why our universe is old

2015-08-19 22:57:59	MrVandelay	Mine would be faster and parallellized

2015-08-19 23:05:02	Roukoswarf	the only weakness is nginx needs a central process for handing out connections, as you cant bind 99999 processes to port 80

2015-08-19 23:05:12	MrVandelay	Roukoswarf: Running third party software in CCM mode on the cray sucks, and process time costs money as the xc-40 costs around $1.4mil annually in electricity alone
2015-08-19 23:05:23	Roukoswarf	MrVandelay: as long as you arent bound to 1 port, and can use a pool of ports, i dont see a problem with 56000 cores.

2015-08-19 23:35:53	Roukoswarf	i once tried to update to windows 8.1 from 8
2015-08-19 23:36:01	cologate	anyway, I need to go
2015-08-19 23:36:02	Roukoswarf	i did all win8 updates

2015-08-19 23:36:08	Roukoswarf	then, hit update to 8.1

2015-08-19 23:36:15	Roukoswarf	came back
2015-08-19 23:36:19	Roukoswarf	not done yet
2015-08-19 23:36:25	MrVandelay	mankypirate: I haven't used that since Win NT 4 classes for A+ certification. That course taught me everything I needed to know. Like token ring networks with coax cables.
2015-08-19 23:36:39	Roukoswarf	never ended up finishing, wiped it and installed 8.1 oem
2015-08-19 23:36:48	mankypirate	Roukoswarf: I tried win10 first but it kept hard freezing every 5 min so badly not even the mouse moved or ctrl+alt+del worked

2015-08-19 23:46:43	FastCode	I tend to use pxe for that

2015-08-20 00:44:18	FastCode	he knows that
2015-08-20 00:44:33	FastCode	You need to install Flash Player to play this content.
2015-08-20 00:44:44	FastCode	news sites really need to learn from porn sites
2015-08-20 00:44:55	FastCode	they all support html5
2015-08-20 00:45:02	cologate	why do porn sites have great video players?
2015-08-20 00:45:10	MrVandelay	Because of supply and demand working
2015-08-20 00:45:14	FastCode	because they have big $
2015-08-20 00:45:33	FastCode	well said
2015-08-20 00:46:10	MrVandelay	This 50% masi grappa is really nice for a nightcap. It warms.

2015-08-20 00:46:16	MrVandelay	Not as much as absinthe though.
2015-08-20 00:46:18	LambdaComplex	cologate: Because if their player doesn't work immediately suddenly their user is on a completely different site 
2015-08-20 00:46:28	cologate	that is true
2015-08-20 00:46:44	MrVandelay	But I have a problematic relationship with absinthe. I like it a lot, but it makes me do really stupid things. Even though it doesn't contain wormwood over here.
2015-08-20 00:47:24	FastCode	all kinds of whiskey make me do stupid things, so i stopped drinking it altogether
2015-08-20 00:47:39	cologate	I have the same problem with just drinking
2015-08-20 00:47:46	cologate	when I get drunk, I do stupid shit
2015-08-20 00:47:47	MrVandelay	Absinthe actually got me to sleep with my psycho wiccan ex when I got back to Stockholm. Who torched my living room table with gasoline
2015-08-20 00:47:51	FastCode	well, tequila is ok
2015-08-20 00:48:12	FastCode	I can drink as much as i want
2015-08-20 00:48:17	MrVandelay	Ah. I'm not really that affected by the other alcohols.
2015-08-20 00:48:19	cologate	especially if I take anything else while drinking
2015-08-20 00:48:37	FastCode	holly shit
2015-08-20 00:48:46	FastCode	for realz?
2015-08-20 00:49:18	cologate	who, FastCode?
2015-08-20 00:49:19	MrVandelay	But absinthe specifically the 75% taboo absinthe makes me do stuff. Like, when I got back to Sweden and met my psycho ex after not having seen her or talked to her (i actually went to a different country with another girl for a few years) she was pissed off at me and I just ignored her because I was there with friends (her co workers)
2015-08-20 00:49:26	FastCode	her ex
2015-08-20 00:49:33	FastCode	torching living room
2015-08-20 00:50:02	MrVandelay	She of course couldn't stand the fact that the world didn't revolve around her so she came up to the bar where I was talking to a colleague and stood infront of me with her back turned towards me just to show that she's pissed off at me
2015-08-20 00:50:28	FastCode	wow
2015-08-20 00:50:30	MrVandelay	From what I heard from the bartender my response was to grab her pretty roughly by the hair and kissing her and then we went off and talked for an hour or so (i can't remember this at all)
2015-08-20 00:50:33	MrVandelay	and we took a cab to my place
2015-08-20 00:50:47	cologate	oh jeez
2015-08-20 00:50:56	FastCode	^^
2015-08-20 00:51:14	cologate	if there's more, I'm listening
2015-08-20 00:51:18	MrVandelay	She's into rough so it's not really a problem. But that could've gone 50/50 since she's bipolar
2015-08-20 00:51:21	FastCode	lol
2015-08-20 00:51:32	MrVandelay	Her emotional states are all over the place for all and no reasons
2015-08-20 00:52:04	FastCode	I need pictures for the story to feel more real
2015-08-20 00:52:20	MrVandelay	Anyways, I kinda sobered up around 5am when she was leaving and I was pretending to sleep while thinking "oh god" repeatedly
2015-08-20 00:52:24	MrVandelay	haha of her?
2015-08-20 00:52:35	FastCode	ahaha
2015-08-20 00:52:47	FastCode	'repeatedly'
2015-08-20 00:52:48	MrVandelay	Then I had this huge problem because..
2015-08-20 00:52:58	FastCode	she thought you're back together
2015-08-20 00:52:58	cologate	that's fucking hilarious, at least she didn't fuck with you while you were asleep
2015-08-20 00:52:59	MrVandelay	I couldn't remember what I had told her
2015-08-20 00:53:26	MrVandelay	so I didn't know if we were back together or not and it's kinda hard to communicate with a bipolar person if I had foolishly told her that I love her or something like that
2015-08-20 00:53:34	MrVandelay	I had zero memory at all of anything beyond standing at the bar
2015-08-20 00:54:01	MrVandelay	and now it's kinda awkward.
2015-08-20 00:54:12	FastCode	wait, was this recent?
2015-08-20 00:54:18	cologate	wait, it's still an issue?
2015-08-20 00:54:32	FastCode	you said ex
2015-08-20 00:55:20	FastCode	I think he fell asleep
2015-08-20 00:55:31	MrVandelay	Yeah she was my ex ex
2015-08-20 00:55:42	cologate	ex ex?
2015-08-20 00:55:46	MrVandelay	but I slept with her after drinking absinthe when I got back to Stockholm from breaking up with my recent ex
2015-08-20 00:55:56	MrVandelay	Yeah like, ex ex.. the ex before my recent ex
2015-08-20 00:56:01	cologate	oh, okay
2015-08-20 00:57:06	MrVandelay	She was jealous about the fact that after I broke up with her I fell into a relationship with a prettier and younger girl
2015-08-20 00:57:30	MrVandelay	she was jealous that she was younger, and my ex was jealous that my previous girlfriend was more mature
2015-08-20 00:57:51	FastCode	gaud
2015-08-20 00:57:56	MrVandelay	then the ex ex stalked me for about 7 months
2015-08-20 00:58:17	FastCode	Now I need a picture of you
2015-08-20 00:58:26	MrVandelay	convinced that this new girl had just affected me with her crimson circle powers or evil magic or whatever the hell she believes in

2015-08-20 10:14:14	cologate	is there any way to check which filesystem is on a partition?
2015-08-20 10:14:32	cologate	or could I just use mkfs and see the errors
2015-08-20 10:14:43	dunz0r	cologate: I think you can read the header in some way

2015-08-20 10:15:03	cologate	thanks arbitrar 
2015-08-20 10:15:20	dunz0r	arbitrar: But doesn't it have to be mounted for that?
2015-08-20 10:15:29	MrElendig	you can only make a educated guess
2015-08-20 10:15:51	arbitrar	oh yeah
2015-08-20 10:15:56	dunz0r	I think you should be able to identify it by looking at the header
2015-08-20 10:15:57	MrElendig	easiest way is often to just mount it
2015-08-20 10:16:04	cologate	I already had it mounted
2015-08-20 10:16:24	cologate	just wanted to make sure I had the right filesystems on the right partitions
2015-08-20 10:16:56	dunz0r	cologate: I think parted can do it
2015-08-20 10:17:00	dunz0r	parted -l
2015-08-20 10:17:09	arbitrar	or maybe blkid -o list
2015-08-20 10:17:17	MrElendig	file and blkid can guess
2015-08-20 10:17:28	MrElendig	I've had blkid/lsblk fail on me though
2015-08-20 10:18:07	cologate	oh, those are both pretty cool
2015-08-20 10:18:18	cologate	fdisk shows too many things, like all the loopbacks on the livecd

2015-08-20 10:20:48	cologate	I'm not using ext4 here
2015-08-20 10:20:53	cologate	btrfs and ext2
2015-08-20 10:21:01	cologate	so it should be all good
2015-08-20 10:22:00	sheep	why ext2?
2015-08-20 10:22:45	cologate	no journaling, so it takes up less space on small partitions
2015-08-20 10:22:50	cologate	such as a boot partition
2015-08-20 10:23:15	sheep	uh
2015-08-20 10:23:23	sheep	ext4 can have the journal disabled
2015-08-20 10:23:36	cologate	really?
2015-08-20 10:23:38	mar77i	boot partitions are usually whatever your firmware can read on efi devices, and ext3 I'm pretty damn sure isn't on the list.
2015-08-20 10:23:41	sheep	iirc there may be a way to set the journal size too
2015-08-20 10:23:50	sheep	yeah, tune2fs -O ^has_journal
2015-08-20 10:23:54	sheep	or something like that
2015-08-20 10:24:10	sheep	ext4 has some other things making it different than ext3 and 2 besides journaling
2015-08-20 10:24:29	cologate	mar, I'm not on an efi computer right now
2015-08-20 10:24:44	cologate	sheep, I'll check it out, thanks
2015-08-20 10:25:44	cologate	I thought there were issues with ext4 if the filesystem fills up

2015-08-21 00:25:49	houn	IF I'm reading this correctly, playerctl reads status/controls players via dbus, so that means that dbus isn't aware of mpd

2015-08-21 07:35:48	Hypersurface	Probably the second
2015-08-21 07:35:51	nuun	don't have to install Alsa to handle Pulseaudio.

2015-08-21 07:40:33	Hypersurface	nope
2015-08-21 07:40:41	Hypersurface	My issues are mainly with pulse
2015-08-21 07:40:55	LambdaComplex	Pulse uses alsa
2015-08-21 07:41:13	Hypersurface	but whenever I use an alsa application, that hijacks all of my audio and nothing else can output sound
2015-08-21 07:41:23	Hypersurface	so I use pulse as a sound server
2015-08-21 07:41:38	Hypersurface	and that routes everything though alsa if I'm not mistaken
2015-08-21 07:41:50	Hypersurface	under what it thinks to be one device
2015-08-21 07:42:02	Hypersurface	so that's a workaround right there
2015-08-21 07:42:42	Hypersurface	then when using voip applications like mumble, if I don't select alsa as my device for playback, my music is interrupted every song change
2015-08-21 07:42:45	Hypersurface	idk why lol
2015-08-21 07:42:46	LambdaComplex	It's been a while since I messed with stuff. Pardon me while I try to remember shit
2015-08-21 07:42:58	Hypersurface	so I work around that too
2015-08-21 07:43:07	LambdaComplex	Have you checked your pulse config file?
2015-08-21 07:43:09	Hypersurface	I'll ask #archlinux when I want to actually sort this out
2015-08-21 07:43:12	Hypersurface	yeah
2015-08-21 07:43:19	Hypersurface	I've messed with autospawn
2015-08-21 07:43:27	Hypersurface	and sample rates
2015-08-21 07:43:58	LambdaComplex	Have you verified alsa is actually using pulse as the mixer?
2015-08-21 07:43:59	Hypersurface	setting both the alternative sample rate and the default one to 44.1khz seems to create the least glitches
2015-08-21 07:44:06	Hypersurface	it is
2015-08-21 07:44:37	LambdaComplex	Played around with pavucontrol?
2015-08-21 07:44:41	Hypersurface	yep
2015-08-21 07:44:53	Hypersurface	pavucontrol is a lifesaver for me sometimes
2015-08-21 07:45:37	LambdaComplex	Yep
2015-08-21 07:45:47	LambdaComplex	Sounds like your problem is over my head though

2015-08-21 07:47:43	LambdaComplex	That only happens every day :P
2015-08-21 07:47:58	Hypersurface	Like I said, when I care to stop doing endless amounts of workarounds, I'll bring it to #archlinux
2015-08-21 07:49:27	Hypersurface	But my McGyver solutions are working for me most of the time
2015-08-21 07:51:29	Hypersurface	One thing I've learned about Arch Linux: everything on the wiki that is stated or presented as a less common solution to doing something is the one that applies to you.
2015-08-21 07:52:02	arbitrar	i used to have a problem where there couldn't be more than 6 audio outputs if one of those was flash player
2015-08-21 07:52:11	arbitrar	but that inexplicably stopped when i stopped using kde
2015-08-21 07:52:28	Hypersurface	kde does have some weird plasma sound server though
2015-08-21 07:52:36	Hypersurface	forgot what it was called
2015-08-21 07:52:49	Hypersurface	so that's another layer of something that could screw your audio
2015-08-21 07:52:58	arbitrar	phonon, i believe
2015-08-21 07:53:03	Hypersurface	yeah
2015-08-21 07:53:19	arbitrar	but that was optional, you could replace it with gstreamer and vlc backend
2015-08-21 07:53:25	arbitrar	*or, not and
2015-08-21 07:53:47	Hypersurface	I always had issues with phonon
2015-08-21 07:53:55	Hypersurface	gstreamer would never output my audio
2015-08-21 07:54:18	Hypersurface	and vlc would only output my music when I wasn't using my mic in an application
2015-08-21 07:54:20	Hypersurface	but only my music
2015-08-21 07:54:34	arbitrar	yeah, same issues here
2015-08-21 07:54:50	Hypersurface	idk what it is about music players and voip applications, but they don't cooperate nicely on my setup
2015-08-21 07:55:00	arbitrar	so then i switched to gnome and then eventually awesome and then i3
2015-08-21 07:55:18	Hypersurface	Yeah, I trashed gnome for xfce and eventually awesome
2015-08-21 07:55:31	Hypersurface	never really used kde because of sound
2015-08-21 07:55:44	arbitrar	right now i'm using basically all of xfce except for the wm
2015-08-21 07:55:54	Hypersurface	xfce is great
2015-08-21 07:56:58	Hypersurface	I'm trying to force myself to learn linux terminal commands though, so I'm going without a DE
2015-08-21 07:57:03	Hypersurface	or file manager
2015-08-21 07:57:22	Hypersurface	everything that I can move to a terminal minus a web browser has been moved over
2015-08-21 07:57:27	nuun	I was impressed by Fedora's GNOME setup. Am setting up GNOME right now, without GDM.
2015-08-21 07:57:32	arbitrar	do you use a console file manager or just navigate with cd
2015-08-21 07:57:36	nuun	Going to use it on Wayland.
2015-08-21 07:57:42	Hypersurface	cd is my file managment
2015-08-21 07:58:07	Hypersurface	I should check out gnome again sometime soon
2015-08-21 07:58:11	arbitrar	i use a mix between thunar and ranger
2015-08-21 07:58:15	Hypersurface	Haven't seen it for three years
2015-08-21 07:58:20	Hypersurface	I have ranger installed
2015-08-21 07:58:35	Hypersurface	I don't find it very intuitive though
2015-08-21 07:58:54	arbitrar	what's a good display manager
2015-08-21 07:58:57	Hypersurface	terminal commands are easier for me to do than to learn some hotkeys
2015-08-21 07:59:10	Hypersurface	arbitrar: startx
2015-08-21 07:59:11	Hypersurface	:P

2015-08-21 08:00:07	arbitrar	how do i automatically do startx after login
2015-08-21 08:00:09	arbitrar	i did it once then forgot

2015-08-21 08:00:19	Hypersurface	it should do that automatically
2015-08-21 08:00:29	Hypersurface	but I remember mine not as well
2015-08-21 08:00:34	Hypersurface	there's a wiki page on it
2015-08-21 08:00:35	nuun	I am going to do something with mosh+abduco+dvtm+tmux for terminal and xpra for graphical, if it will handle Xwayland.
2015-08-21 08:00:46	nuun	s/terminal/console
2015-08-21 08:01:36	arbitrar	fuck it, i'll just keep lightdm. it works and i'm not in the mood to configure shit
2015-08-21 08:01:55	Hypersurface	if you have lightdm and that works, then keep it
2015-08-21 08:02:25	Hypersurface	I have a friend who didn't know what he was doing and used lightdm
2015-08-21 08:02:31	Hypersurface	seems to work well for him lol
2015-08-21 08:02:56	arbitrar	i have auto-login on so i never see lightdm anyway
2015-08-21 08:03:10	MrVandelay	why do you use lightdm if you have autologin?
2015-08-21 08:03:16	MrVandelay	that makes no sense at all
2015-08-21 08:03:34	arbitrar	because i used to not have auto-login

2015-08-21 08:09:51	MrVandelay	wasamasa: Exactly. Why use *nix at all? You can emulate Arch Linux from within Windows using VMWare so it's better
2015-08-21 08:10:13	MrVandelay	I meant virtualize but whatever.
2015-08-21 08:10:30	wasamasa	well, I doubt you can find a proper analogy for it
2015-08-21 08:10:33	MrVandelay	Let's say he's emulating arch linux ARM in Qemu and my original statement works ^^
2015-08-21 08:11:27	wasamasa	I'm just cranky about people having managed to design an emacs starterkit aimed at making vim people jump ship
2015-08-21 08:11:38	wasamasa	it's now the most popular one of the bunch on github
2015-08-21 08:11:38	MrVandelay	I don't mind that
2015-08-21 08:12:11	wasamasa	they have the same claim, "Don't pick Emacs or Vim if you can have both!"
2015-08-21 08:12:18	wasamasa	what they omit is that it's a fuckton more complex
2015-08-21 08:12:24	MrVandelay	Exactly
2015-08-21 08:12:42	wasamasa	combine that with a starterkit and you get the weirdest bugs
2015-08-21 08:12:44	MrVandelay	Being serious for a moment, even though Emacs isn't an operating system, it is a full blown IDE. Which is great if you want an IDE

2015-08-21 08:13:04	wasamasa	I view it more as a proto-IDE
2015-08-21 08:13:21	wasamasa	gives you all the tools to build your own, then leaves you hanging if you don't want to build your own
2015-08-21 08:13:33	MrVandelay	ah
2015-08-21 08:14:03	MrVandelay	I don't really dislike emacs. I just like to pick on it because of nostalgic memories from when I cared about unix feuds 15 years ago
2015-08-21 08:14:16	wasamasa	like, tough luck if you're a php programmer because nobody wrote a tool for auto-completion, let alone, integration for it into emacs
2015-08-21 08:14:52	MrVandelay	But that's the unix ethos, if it doesn't exist - create it
2015-08-21 08:15:03	wasamasa	good luck getting php people to do that
2015-08-21 08:15:11	wasamasa	or vim converts in this case
2015-08-21 08:15:30	MrVandelay	Honestly, I'm not sure if we want php addicts hacking away in emacs

2015-08-21 12:15:09	MrVandelay	I just realized how that sounds out of context ^^
2015-08-21 12:15:35	dunz0r	MrVandelay: I have made "real" currys, yeah. It's not a lot of work, you just let it sit on the stove for a few hours, add some spices every hour or so
2015-08-21 12:16:08	MrVandelay	Yeah I think that, if you disregard the time it takes, it's kind of easier as you can just leave it on the stove most of the time
2015-08-21 12:16:31	MrVandelay	with frying you typically end up having to do a lot in a short period of time
2015-08-21 12:16:34	dunz0r	MrVandelay: Yeah, I just go and do something else for a while and get up and make sure it's ok every hour or so
2015-08-21 12:16:48	MrVandelay	Yeah exactly. It's a bit more 'peaceful'
2015-08-21 12:17:08	dunz0r	There's an indian restuarant nearby my work that has amazing vindaloo sometimes
2015-08-21 12:17:17	dunz0r	They let it cook for like 15 hours
2015-08-21 12:17:33	dunz0r	It's so incredibly spicy, but full of taste as well
2015-08-21 12:17:44	dunz0r	Brings tears to my eyes because it's so hot, but damn it tastes good :D
2015-08-21 12:19:40	krosos	real indian food can give you hospital conditions^^ a sister of my grandmother was working in India for years, and they got the food made for the workers not from india, and it still caused longterm damage she had to fix afterwards

2015-08-21 12:20:20	dunz0r	MrVandelay: I know. I'm also swedish.

2015-08-21 21:47:30	MrVandelay	archmint: This is early stage R&D, not something complete.
2015-08-21 21:47:56	MrVandelay	archmint: To the public they're of course touting "quantum computing" around because R&D requires funding
2015-08-21 21:47:57	archmint	so, if you are google, and you buy a quantum computer, why would you buy it?
2015-08-21 21:48:10	MrVandelay	Because you're investing in technology research
2015-08-21 21:48:17	archmint	if it provides no advantage
2015-08-21 21:49:20	MrVandelay	Buying a D-Wave at this point (assuming it is a stepping stone to a complete turing machine, and exhibits quantum entanglement) just lends to getting insight into ongoing research
2015-08-21 21:49:26	archmint	people are buying these computers because they can store massive amounts of data - apparently. How can that be if they are, inherently, the same?
2015-08-21 21:50:07	MrVandelay	archmint: No. These things are very fast at a specific linear equation
2015-08-21 21:50:30	MrVandelay	archmint: I can calculate things with my laptop that the D-Wave cannot
2015-08-21 21:51:03	MrVandelay	archmint: The D-Wave is only faster (and only capable of) that one linear equation and thus not turing complete (like our computers presumably are)
2015-08-21 21:51:31	MrVandelay	archmint: What this means is that your laptop can simulate the D-Wave but the D-Wave cannot simulate your laptop

2015-08-21 21:56:18	archmint	What if we made qubits with different voltages?
2015-08-21 21:56:21	Celti	archmint: It's much faster at one thing, but can't do other things. However, if you need to do that one thing a lot and quickly, it's a worthwhile investment, and helps fund more research into making quantum computing more general-purpose.
2015-08-21 21:57:04	archmint	0 < 25%; 1 > 75%; 01 >= 25% && <= 75%
2015-08-21 21:57:14	voidead	I'd certainly say they are valuable
2015-08-21 21:57:29	MrVandelay	archmint: then as I said, it's misleading to call it a computer
2015-08-21 21:57:32	Celti	archmint: qubits don't work that way
2015-08-21 21:58:23	archmint	doesn't matter. if you had 3 states for every bit, then you could exponentially increase memory for every bit, right?
2015-08-21 21:59:17	MrVandelay	archmint: As for quantum, you could call your current processor a quantum processor because it obeys the laws of quantum mechanics. It just doesn't harness the benefits of quantum entanglement which D-Wave supposedly does in this one specific scenario
2015-08-21 21:59:48	Celti	archmint: Ternary computing is a thing, yes, but it's difficult and arguably not worthwhile compared to just making binary computing faster/smaller/more efficient.
2015-08-21 22:00:04	Celti	archmint: also, they're called a 'trit' if they have three states
2015-08-21 22:00:19	Celti	archmint: or a tit if you want to giggle like a thirteen-year-old schoolboy
2015-08-21 22:00:45	archmint	that's why we should invest in it. like d-wave
2015-08-21 22:00:55	MrVandelay	Right, which is why Google and others are buying it.
2015-08-21 22:01:02	MrVandelay	As I already told you
2015-08-21 22:01:04	Ipsilon	if taking advantage of quantum mechanics is enough, can we start calling pendrives quantumdrives?

2015-08-21 22:02:27	Celti	archmint: If binary computers hit a significant stonewall (which has been endlessly predicted but hasn't actually HAPPENED yet), then ternary computing might see new growth.

2015-08-21 22:17:22	Ipsilon	this is one of the things that makes us believe that faster-than-light travel is impossible

2015-08-21 22:22:19	Ipsilon	if you want to sya that photons must have some rest mass, that's fine by me. it doesn't change much of what I was tryying to say
2015-08-21 22:22:47	Celti	The math doesn't break down at all
2015-08-21 22:22:57	Celti	It IS zero, and the math only works if you plug 'zero' in there.

2015-10-01 22:19:49	polyzen	Kirito, a hardlink remains
2015-10-01 22:20:05	polyzen	if you remove the target of a softlink, the softlink remains
2015-10-01 22:20:32	mar77i	symbolic links are like if we made a contract that I won't kick you and then I'll kick and ban you anyway.
2015-10-01 22:20:36	Kirito	Yeah, for some reason I was expecting softlinks to be removed when the original file is removed
2015-10-01 22:20:43	mar77i	whereas a hard link is like joining with a second account.
2015-10-01 22:20:45	escondida	Kirito: A symlink is just a file that has the filename of another file in it
2015-10-01 22:21:16	escondida	Kirito: A hardlink is a file that happens to point to the same inode location as another file.

2015-10-08 20:23:25	crazedpsyc	there are a limited number of things that are actually supported by the modern web, so you don't have to go through everything to see what actually works (to some degree)
2015-10-08 20:23:26	dexter	For example, I was happily using archlinux until they updated the kernel to 4.2, broke my catalyst and linux-lts doesn't boot. You know what the first word out of my mouth was when I saw my system refuse to boot? "shit"

2015-10-08 20:30:15	dexter	I've tried both proprietary and FOSS drivers. The only proprietary driver I can make it so screen tearing doesn't happen is catalyst.
2015-10-08 20:30:23	crazedpsyc	strange
2015-10-08 20:30:56	dexter	and catalyst now depends on linux-lts which doesn't boot on my system, so I'm fucked.
2015-10-08 20:31:08	crazedpsyc	is it better with fewer screens, or landscape-only?
2015-10-08 20:31:36	dexter	doesn't really seem to make any difference. I currently only have one screen and it tears horribly with the free drivers.

2015-10-08 21:03:00	ekkelett	Saying it can walk again is a bit misleading.
2015-10-08 21:03:07	ekkelett	It can drag itself and roll on its wheels.

2015-10-08 21:10:47	ekkelett	"There is no synchronization between the images rendered by the NVIDIA GPU and the output device. This means that the output device can start reading the next frame of video while it is still being updated, producing a graphical artifact known as “tearing”. Tearing is currently expected due to limitations in the design of the X.Org X server."
2015-10-08 21:10:54	crazedpsyc	indeed

2015-10-08 21:11:00	ekkelett	The NVIDIA driver currently only supports the Source Output capability. It does not support render offload and cannot be used as an output sink.

2015-10-09 08:58:37	@phrik	Good (ugt) morning to all from stardome!
2015-10-09 09:07:58	phillid	o/
2015-10-09 09:14:01	stardome	so I'm looking at setting up hosting with something like linode or digital ocean. Any suggestions on what to watch out for or other important factors to be aware of?
2015-10-09 09:14:55	skope	jelle: okay, that might be the case. can you give me an example of the situation where you cannot replicate production well?
2015-10-09 09:15:46	jelle	skope: multiple clients connecting with different client programs
2015-10-09 09:15:49	jelle	and versions
2015-10-09 09:15:51	jelle	and timings
2015-10-09 09:15:58	skope	you cannot mock the connections?
2015-10-09 09:16:11	jelle	you cannot mock connections easily
2015-10-09 09:16:20	jelle	then you have to mock latency
2015-10-09 09:16:44	skope	okay
2015-10-09 09:16:51	skope	thanks for clearing that up
2015-10-09 09:16:59	jelle	I dunno, I have no real experience with this so far :(

2015-10-10 04:09:15	Max-P	So, I have 150GB of music. Over 30k files. A lot of which isn't tagged properly. And I am absolutely terrible at remembering names. Anyone has any idea of how I possibly could sort that in a way that I can find stuff in that mess?
2015-10-10 04:09:48	dfryer1193	Max-P: Folders
2015-10-10 04:10:06	dfryer1193	When you download it, it goes in a folder.
2015-10-10 04:10:11	escondida	Max-P: You could always take the iTunes® approach and just dump the whole mess into a single directory and pretend it makes sense.
2015-10-10 04:10:13	minimalism	I have 114G. A couple months ago I just bit the bullet, spent an entire day or so organizing it all by folder/artist
2015-10-10 04:10:21	minimalism	Then used the tag editor in ncmpcpp to bulk edit
2015-10-10 04:10:27	Max-P	At this point I'm tempted to sort by file creation date, because that's the only point of reference I remember ._.
2015-10-10 04:10:54	dfryer1193	Max-P: take a day to get it organized by folder
2015-10-10 04:11:10	dfryer1193	you'lll be a happier person
2015-10-10 04:11:35	minimalism	Oh wow, you actually have way more files..
2015-10-10 04:11:40	minimalism	I have mostly FLAC, so... 6165
2015-10-10 04:12:49	Max-P	Yeah I thought about sorting by artist/album, but as I said I am absolutely terrible at remembering names. It will be nice and tidy but I won't be able to find a thing in there, so I'm looking for sort of alternate ideas
2015-10-10 04:13:13	minimalism	Remembering names of artists and songs, you mean?
2015-10-10 04:13:19	Max-P	Yeah
2015-10-10 04:13:28	minimalism	Do you ever have like somewhat of an idea?
2015-10-10 04:13:30	minimalism	Like a keyword?
2015-10-10 04:14:43	dfryer1193	Max-P: Would organizing the songs into playlists make more sense to you?
2015-10-10 04:15:05	Max-P	I thought of either sorting by genre, or just by date. Or maybe emotions. Otherwise no, I have no clue, that's why I'm asking :/
2015-10-10 04:15:33	minimalism	https://ptpb.pw/AJ_v3eCsA8RJempnuECcJ4FQXq_H.png
2015-10-10 04:15:43	Max-P	I remember things in kind of a relational way, like "Oh, I listened to this song about a year and a half ago"
2015-10-10 04:15:44	minimalism	If you want to use ncmpcpp, some of its features may help you
2015-10-10 04:15:49	minimalism	it can search by Comments or all sorts of things
2015-10-10 04:16:30	dfryer1193	Max-P: Usually I sort my music by artist, then album. If you tend to remember music by emotion or by time, then sort by that
2015-10-10 04:17:41	Max-P	Alright, I think I'll go with time. From there I can just search the files for artist/title if I ever want to reach songs that way
2015-10-10 04:18:03	Max-P	And probably playlists for the genres I like
2015-10-10 04:18:23	dfryer1193	if it works for you! There's no "right" way to do it, just the way that works best for you
2015-10-10 04:21:33	Max-P	Yeah I'll go for that, thanks for the advices

2015-10-10 05:19:12	bkc_	if it's "hah lol I'm gonna enjoy this"-torture then they'll take their time. but if it's "gimme your password"-torture, then they'll speed it up a bit ^."

2015-10-10 15:10:07	SysGhost	I often use "one", as a gender-neutral expression. Example: "One can try this ..." instead of "He/She can try this..."
2015-10-10 15:10:33	mankypirate	you/they already exists
2015-10-10 15:11:31	SysGhost	One can use "one", if one does not want to point towards a specific individual or group.
2015-10-10 15:11:44	SysGhost	;)
2015-10-10 15:11:52	arselinux	"They" just feels a little more natural imo 
2015-10-10 15:12:06	SysGhost	matter of taste to be honset

2015-10-10 15:12:48	arselinux	right 
2015-10-10 15:12:49	mar77i	...
2015-10-10 15:13:50	CompanionCube	it's a compression thing. Why in the name of everloving fuck does it matter so much that a few (considering we have only one source of evidence, it could be an isolated thing) people might be annoyed at the choice of name
2015-10-10 15:14:19	mankypirate	because people have a right to not be offended... NOT
2015-10-10 15:15:27	 *	mar77i feels obliged to create Compression Under No Threat, which is slow, as it should be, slow as its abbreviation.
2015-10-10 15:16:05	mar77i	"No Tension" would work too, and would likely be more understood
2015-10-10 15:16:20	arselinux	People can be hypersensitive but I don't think it's helpful to write off all concerns about naming conventions at least.

2015-10-10 15:17:27	mar77i	well, what's wrong with "Compression Under No Tension", really? It would have most certainly an inoffensive abbreviation.

2015-10-10 19:10:58	blueblur112198	makepkgnotwar: is that powerline
2015-10-10 19:11:01	blueblur112198	makepkgnotwar: or airline
2015-10-10 19:11:17	dexter	tigrmesh: Eh. I'm going to a place where cellphone usage isn't allowed anyways so I'm just gonna cancel out the contract.
2015-10-10 19:11:22	makepkgnotwar	airline?
2015-10-10 19:11:28	makepkgnotwar	I just installed it and kinda forgot already
2015-10-10 19:11:30	dexter	no sense in paying $70/month for a phone I can't use.
2015-10-10 19:11:34	blueblur112198	airline is an alternative to powerline
2015-10-10 19:11:38	makepkgnotwar	yeah vim-airline
2015-10-10 19:11:45	blueblur112198	still uses powerline fonts and things
2015-10-10 19:11:49	blueblur112198	powerline is in python
2015-10-10 19:11:55	blueblur112198	which really really sucks
2015-10-10 19:11:59	makepkgnotwar	so's airline... I think
2015-10-10 19:12:03	makepkgnotwar	or was that ranger...
2015-10-10 19:12:12	blueblur112198	airline is in vimscript iirc
2015-10-10 19:12:12	dexter	powerline rapidly turned into a gigantic pile of crap.
2015-10-10 19:12:17	blueblur112198	dexter: yes
2015-10-10 19:12:19	makepkgnotwar	oh yeah
2015-10-10 19:12:21	makepkgnotwar	vimscript
2015-10-10 19:12:22	blueblur112198	and now there
2015-10-10 19:12:25	blueblur112198	is airline
2015-10-10 19:12:33	makepkgnotwar	I basically made my own airline then
2015-10-10 19:12:34	dexter	you want vim-powerline? HERE HAVE zsh-powerline and screen powerline and all this other garbage!
2015-10-10 19:12:45	makepkgnotwar	when you entered --insert--, etc, the statusbar would change colors
2015-10-10 19:12:49	makepkgnotwar	xD
2015-10-10 19:12:55	blueblur112198	airline does that

2015-10-12 03:44:52	voidead	on the internet or on the arch wiki?
2015-10-12 03:45:04	houn	The internet in general, including the arch wiki.
2015-10-12 03:45:17	viscera	i'd say the source code is objective ;)

2015-10-12 03:46:13	voidead	the arch wiki really is lacking I'll admit
2015-10-12 03:46:32	voidead	people just need to write up more info
2015-10-12 03:46:33	voidead	in fact
2015-10-12 03:46:57	voidead	I had to revise a part of the wiki about ntpd and systemd-timesyncd
2015-10-12 03:47:11	voidead	they were completely unclear about the distinction
2015-10-12 03:47:18	voidead	and expected everyone to just know
2015-10-12 03:48:04	houn	Wait, was ntpd replaced?
2015-10-12 03:48:09	voidead	oh nah
2015-10-12 03:48:40	voidead	they just didn't make it clear the difference between the two.. as systemd-timesyncd uses ntp too
2015-10-12 03:48:44	voidead	but not _ntpd_
2015-10-12 03:49:00	viscera	houn: client systems are meant to use timesyncd
2015-10-12 03:49:01	voidead	too fucking vague
2015-10-12 03:49:06	viscera	houn: i.e. if they're not ntp peers
2015-10-12 03:50:47	voidead	so if you have systemd-timesyncd on and you ran ntpd too.. its not going to work like you expect.. you need to have one or the other running not both
2015-10-12 03:51:07	voidead	they both use different config files

2015-10-12 04:01:13	houn	What's the polling interval?  Does it do any math to deal with delay jitter, or does it not give a shit?
2015-10-12 04:02:18	houn	How does it handle corrections?  Does it slowly drift a wrong clock back, or does it just WAM smash it into sync like ntpdate?

2015-10-12 04:08:53	voidead	but I mean
2015-10-12 04:08:59	voidead	it depends on systemd ultimately
2015-10-12 04:10:05	voidead	and really it will depend on your configuration 
2015-10-12 04:10:25	voidead	and well.. it uses ntp.. but not _ntpd_
2015-10-12 04:10:29	voidead	if that makes sense
2015-10-12 04:10:46	voidead	and you have to enable ntp
2015-10-12 04:11:00	voidead	or at least make sure its enabled if you want that configuration
2015-10-12 04:11:37	voidead	yes it does have a drift file

2015-10-12 04:12:12	voidead	although.. not sure if that is for ntpd or the timesyncd 
2015-10-12 04:12:55	houn	I'm reading the source code now.
2015-10-12 04:13:27	houn	And yeah, it appears to operate largely the same way as ntpd does, just without also being a server for other ntp clients to poll.
2015-10-12 04:14:26	houn	It also appears to dynamically adjust it's polling interval based on confidence levels the way mtpd does, though it isn't as agressive on the whole about time upkeep.
2015-10-12 04:14:45	houn	Why the fuck did I have to find the source code to learn these things?

2015-10-12 06:24:58	Hypersurface	What Halfwit said
2015-10-12 06:25:00	Halfwit	You have an algorithm that you can compute disparate parts in parallel, 
2015-10-12 06:25:02	+bkc_	Hypersurface: without it doing anything distributed, it's just a bunch of networked computers...
2015-10-12 06:25:16	Hypersurface	Yes
2015-10-12 06:25:30	Hypersurface	But it's a bunch of networked computers that can potentially do something
2015-10-12 06:26:03	+bkc_	okey, then I already have a cluster... it's called "my home network" :)
2015-10-12 06:26:07	Halfwit	Like... say you want to clean up an image, you can send a piece out to each computer, run the routine to clean up that section, and then stitch it back together (not the greatest example, but one nonetheless)
2015-10-12 06:26:19	Hypersurface	Fine, I'll calculate some stupidly high number on it

2015-10-12 06:27:52	+bkc_	clustering is just spreading a workload over several machines
2015-10-12 06:28:04	Josh|SYN	ideally, I'd want each computer's CPU to be represented as thread in C++, and if memory is full malloc would use other computer's resources :P
2015-10-12 06:28:08	Halfwit	It's highly unlikely (at least today, right now) that you're going to be playing crisis on the beast.

2015-10-12 08:50:55	bougyman	yes
2015-10-12 08:51:02	dunz0r	voidead: I have. It's great.
2015-10-12 08:51:04	bougyman	it's vendor-locked in chat.
2015-10-12 08:51:07	bougyman	it's ass
2015-10-12 08:51:19	dunz0r	It's IRC with a bot and file-uploads... no vendor lockins.
2015-10-12 08:51:25	bougyman	bullshit
2015-10-12 08:51:29	voidead	hmm
2015-10-12 08:51:32	bougyman	the irc gateway is shit, as is the web ui.
2015-10-12 08:51:34	voidead	well we are off to a great start
2015-10-12 08:51:49	dunz0r	voidead: I like it anyway. I used it quite a bit last year
2015-10-12 08:52:11	bougyman	not that I love hipchat (we use it at dayjob), but even it's better than slack.
2015-10-12 08:52:11	voidead	I'm joined to a team but I never use it much as they never use it either
2015-10-12 08:52:14	voidead	so
2015-10-12 08:52:20	dunz0r	voidead: You could have almost all the same fucntionality with just an irc-channel and a few bots and stuff, but now you don't have to
2015-10-12 08:52:32	voidead	dunz0r, so its like.. lazy irc?
2015-10-12 08:52:42	dunz0r	voidead: It has a good mobile client as well
2015-10-12 08:52:44	jelle	dunz0r: weird ass php
2015-10-12 08:52:49	Josh|SYN	I wonder why people prefer to use terminal rather than an IDE for source code editing
2015-10-12 08:52:49	bougyman	minus the ability to use irc clients.
2015-10-12 08:53:00	bougyman	Josh|SYN: the two aren't mutually exclusive.
2015-10-12 08:53:05	bougyman	lots of vim and emacs ides.
2015-10-12 08:53:08	Josh|SYN	It is somehow because they are masochist?
2015-10-12 08:53:13	voidead	I'd use Slack more if I were joined to a team with more people
2015-10-12 08:53:14	dunz0r	(and you can just connect with an IRC client)
2015-10-12 08:53:25	bougyman	only if you don't mind being disconnected all the time.
2015-10-12 08:53:26	voidead	dunz0r, yeah I know
2015-10-12 08:53:42	dunz0r	Or xmpp if that's your thing
2015-10-12 08:53:46	voidead	dunz0r, I mean I've used it.. I just wondered how people feel about it.. by the way.. anyone care to add me to a slack team?
2015-10-12 08:53:51	Josh|SYN	ok why vim vs visual studio?
2015-10-12 08:53:54	bougyman	the xmpp bitlbee to slack was a bit more stable.
2015-10-12 08:54:02	bougyman	still 5+ disconnects/day, on average.
2015-10-12 08:54:12	bougyman	granted we tried it when it was pretty new.
2015-10-12 08:54:16	bougyman	maybe they've stabilized now.
2015-10-12 08:54:20	voidead	bougyman, the twitter/bitlbee thing is annoying
2015-10-12 08:54:20	dunz0r	I don't like that I can't host it myself though
2015-10-12 08:54:30	voidead	dunz0r, yeah
2015-10-12 08:54:39	bougyman	i'm not a tweeter, so iono about that.
2015-10-12 08:54:45	voidead	well I love bitlbee.. but shit is always disconnecting
2015-10-12 08:54:58	dunz0r	It's ok for non-work stuff, but it doesn't cut it for work
2015-10-12 08:55:02	dunz0r	Since you can't selfhost it
2015-10-12 08:55:05	bougyman	it disconnects about once/week from hipchat (my bitlbee)
2015-10-12 08:55:07	voidead	dunz0r, I hea you
2015-10-12 08:55:12	bougyman	utterly tolerable.
2015-10-12 08:55:38	bougyman	slack and facebook disconnect all the time.
2015-10-12 08:55:48	bougyman	i just checked and I still have my slack connection on my bitlbee.
2015-10-12 08:55:53	dunz0r	voidead: A good thing about it Slack is all the "connections". Me and my team(for a non-profit thingie) have it connected to trello, google docs and github
2015-10-12 08:55:54	bougyman	11 disconnects yesterday.
2015-10-12 08:56:12	dunz0r	So as soon something happens on trello or github, there's a message in the channel \o/
2015-10-12 08:56:25	voidead	yeah 
2015-10-12 08:56:29	bougyman	so like any bot.
2015-10-12 08:56:29	dunz0r	I never ran it in an irc-client, the web ui is good enough.
2015-10-12 08:56:34	voidead	I think Slack is quite useful for certain circumstances
2015-10-12 08:56:38	dunz0r	And the mobile client is nice
2015-10-12 08:56:49	voidead	dunz0r, I ran it on weechat.. it disconnected a lot
2015-10-12 08:56:56	dunz0r	voidead: Yeah, like teams where you don't meet every day.
2015-10-12 08:57:19	dunz0r	Time to start using it again for that team soon
2015-10-12 08:57:38	voidead	like I said.. feel free to add me if anyone is using Slack
2015-10-12 08:57:39	dunz0r	Me, bkc_ and a few other people. It's for a big lan/demo-party
2015-10-12 08:57:50	voidead	I don't know anyone who uses it except like two people
2015-10-12 08:58:20	dunz0r	voidead: Unfortunately I can't add you to the teams, since we talk about stuff that aren't meant to be shared :(
2015-10-12 08:58:36	dunz0r	Like passwords and stuff
2015-10-12 08:58:51	dunz0r	(which I really should find a better solution for)
2015-10-12 08:59:07	dunz0r	An encrypted file on someone elses server isn't very good
2015-10-12 09:00:56	voidead	dunz0r, why not use tox
2015-10-12 09:01:01	voidead	thats a great solution
2015-10-12 09:01:52	dunz0r	It lacks a web-ui, has no file-upload-support and not trello-integration

2015-10-12 09:10:10	bougyman	voidead: yes, of course. as am I. not particularly anti-systemd as pro-runit.
2015-10-12 09:10:18	voidead	ah yeah
2015-10-12 09:10:28	voidead	what are the benefits of using runit?
2015-10-12 09:10:35	bougyman	void moved to systemd for a few months and the founder/author hated it.
2015-10-12 09:10:50	bougyman	voidead: no kernel limitations (can run it on ancient kernels and don't have to lock runit versions to kernel versions).
2015-10-12 09:10:57	bougyman	that's one of the biggest, as a maintainer.
2015-10-12 09:11:02	dunz0r	bougyman: Phabricator looks really cool. I'll have to take a proper look at it. Thanks for the tip.
2015-10-12 09:11:08	voidead	its ironic that my nick is voidead lol I didn't hear about it until one day someone posted a screenshot in here about it
2015-10-12 09:11:34	bougyman	dunz0r: I avoided it forever because it was in php. but those phalicty people who build it are all ex-facebookers (phab was an internal facebook thing before it went opensource).
2015-10-12 09:11:43	bougyman	they write good clean easy to extend php, if you can believe it.
2015-10-12 09:11:50	voidead	I might run it in a virtual environment sometime bougyman just to try it out
2015-10-12 09:12:05	mar77i	voidlinux is silly...
2015-10-12 09:12:21	voidead	I actually like systemd though
2015-10-12 09:12:28	dunz0r	I wonder if there's a mobile client...
2015-10-12 09:12:31	voidead	but voidlinux seems neat regardless
2015-10-12 09:12:44	dunz0r	I like that about Slack. I can highlight people that are "offline"
2015-10-12 09:12:54	dunz0r	Since the mobile client will ping when you highlight someone
2015-10-12 09:14:07	mar77i	I once made a bug report... and the result was the opposite of what I requested.
2015-10-12 09:14:47	mar77i	but who am I to tell other people how to format their packager output... :)

2015-10-12 09:15:28	mar77i	especially in respect to scriptability, the dev insisted it was the right solution to solve the issue with tens of lines of code added.
2015-10-12 09:15:28	voidead	dunz0r, yeah I like Slack.. but like I said I don't know anyone who uses it
2015-10-12 09:16:36	dunz0r	voidead: Now you do! \o/
2015-10-12 09:16:37	dunz0r	:D
2015-10-12 09:16:51	voidead	hey maybe I should open up a new team and add you guys
2015-10-12 09:17:07	dunz0r	But why?:O
2015-10-12 09:17:22	dunz0r	Just using slack as a chat-platform is a bit unnecessary
2015-10-12 09:17:30	voidead	I suppose
2015-10-12 09:17:33	dunz0r	It's great as a collaboration tool though
2015-10-12 09:17:46	voidead	but why like Slack if you have no one to enjoy using it with lol
2015-10-12 09:17:59	dunz0r	I have people to use it with :)
2015-10-12 09:18:24	voidead	I actually thought maybe.. like.. if I convince my family and friends to join a Slack team I created will they finally stop using facebook?
2015-10-12 09:18:31	dunz0r	Slack, Trello, github and a Wiki is what we use in that team.
2015-10-12 09:18:41	dunz0r	voidead: Hmmm. maybe. But I doubt it.
2015-10-12 09:18:51	dunz0r	People want to click "Like" and stuff like that
2015-10-12 09:18:59	voidead	I'll at least get a few friends to use Slack I know that much
2015-10-12 09:19:28	dunz0r	voidead: Get them to use IRC instead. A shared irc-channel with a funny bot is great for groups of friends, imho
2015-10-12 09:19:36	voidead	they don't understand irc so no one is on irc.. so I just thought Slack is easier for people who are irc illiterate
2015-10-12 09:19:39	dunz0r	Ah.
2015-10-12 09:21:12	minimalism	It's really a shame (or maybe it isn't) that IRC isn't more accessible to normies even when there's a clickable protocol for the web with irc://

2015-10-12 09:24:09	voidead	hmm
2015-10-12 09:24:11	minimalism	voidead: You have no idea how happy I'd be if everyone I knew stopped using skype in favor of something I could use in tty.
2015-10-12 09:24:16	dunz0r	And it's all not computer people. Some normal people as well
2015-10-12 09:24:19	voidead	I mean.. like my parents.. or my cousins etc..
2015-10-12 09:24:34	dunz0r	minimalism: Or just something that you didn't need to use skype for. Fucking hate that application
2015-10-12 09:24:43	dunz0r	It's slow, buggy and stupid.
2015-10-12 09:24:47	voidead	like just have a channel called "#family" and everyone talks
2015-10-12 09:24:52	minimalism	Skype is the last bit of microsoft cancer on me
2015-10-12 09:25:21	voidead	someone told me I needed to use Skype.. and I'm like.. I'm not installing that shit on my computer 
2015-10-12 09:25:26	dunz0r	voidead: Yeah, and everyone is using a BNC or shell-server \o/
2015-10-12 09:25:27	voidead	I had to just put it on my phone
2015-10-12 09:25:44	dunz0r	voidead: I install it a few times a year when someone absolutely has to use skype to talk to me
2015-10-12 09:25:47	voidead	dunz0r, are you American?
2015-10-12 09:25:52	dunz0r	voidead: No, I'm swedish.
2015-10-12 09:25:57	voidead	dunz0r, then thats why
2015-10-12 09:26:00	voidead	lol
2015-10-12 09:26:07	minimalism	Son joins #family >Dad: Hey there, son. Check out this magnet link to this amazing pron torrent. >Mom: Don't encourage him, Jim. That's inappropriate.
2015-10-12 09:26:12	dunz0r	Yeah, we're more computer literate here.
2015-10-12 09:26:21	voidead	well
2015-10-12 09:26:26	voidead	I don't know about that
2015-10-12 09:26:32	bougyman	for instance, I don't know any other package manager that allows stuff like xbps-query -R -S mariadb --cat=/etc/mysql/my.cnf
2015-10-12 09:26:33	dunz0r	IRC was how you talked to people with a computer when I was in high school and college.
2015-10-12 09:26:36	dunz0r	Or ICQ
2015-10-12 09:26:37	voidead	just most people don't use irc widely in the US
2015-10-12 09:26:51	bougyman	being able to look at files in packages without installing them.
2015-10-12 09:27:16	voidead	dunz0r, so.. I can't like.. use the same email across teams in Slack?
2015-10-12 09:27:17	dunz0r	voidead: I think it's because computers weren't in every home from as early on as here.
2015-10-12 09:27:28	minimalism	bougyman: Void sounds pretty amazing from what I hear.. I'd consider using it if it had a grsec kernel package.
2015-10-12 09:27:30	dunz0r	voidead: I don't know. I only have one team
2015-10-12 09:27:41	voidead	I'm joined to my friend's team
2015-10-12 09:27:44	bougyman	minimalism: we're discussing selinux and grsec now.
2015-10-12 09:27:45	voidead	but not my own
2015-10-12 09:28:10	minimalism	bougyman: Who's we?
2015-10-12 09:28:15	bougyman	the devs
2015-10-12 09:28:38	bougyman	it seems like selinux will happen first, one of the devs has a hardon for it.
2015-10-12 09:28:40	dunz0r	voidead: Through a program called "Hem-PC"(literally Home-PC) most people could lease computers really cheaply via their jobs in the 90s, I think that really helped with making so that everyone had a computer.
2015-10-12 09:28:48	bougyman	if grsec is going to be done that would probably be me doing it.
2015-10-12 09:28:59	dunz0r	Even in the 90s when computers were super expensive
2015-10-12 09:29:04	minimalism	bougyman: I know it's open source and verified by people who audit it and what not, but the fact that it's NSA developed still makes me averse to it.
2015-10-12 09:29:18	bougyman	minimalism: me, as well.
2015-10-12 09:29:21	bougyman	just a slimey feeling.
2015-10-12 09:29:26	 *	dunz0r remembers the PII 266MHz, 48MB RAM he had via the Home-PC-programme in the 90s.
2015-10-12 09:29:28	minimalism	Yeah, just feels wrong.
2015-10-12 09:29:28	bougyman	but grsec has its own issues.
2015-10-12 09:29:40	voidead	irc has been around since the dawn of the internet and its still relevant to this day.. I don't know why people aren't using it
2015-10-12 09:29:50	minimalism	Doesn't make sense to use a security based piece of software of any kind developed by the literal greatest evil in privacy.
2015-10-12 09:29:56	dunz0r	voidead: It's a bit difficult to "get into" I think.
2015-10-12 09:30:26	dunz0r	It's all commands, you need a client, it doesn't have offline history, no image support and such
2015-10-12 09:30:54	voidead	true
2015-10-12 09:31:01	voidead	but who needs all that anyways
2015-10-12 09:31:05	dunz0r	I lurv irc though. Email and IRC are my main forms of communication
2015-10-12 09:31:10	dunz0r	voidead: Totally agree.
2015-10-12 09:31:14	dunz0r	Less is more and so on
2015-10-12 09:31:32	voidead	some people are obsessed with security and therefore don't use irc 
2015-10-12 09:31:38	voidead	not sure what the hell they are smoking

2015-10-12 09:32:38	dunz0r	Muh securities!
2015-10-12 09:32:43	dunz0r	I don't get it either.
2015-10-12 09:32:47	voidead	anything and everything on the internet is public.. even if you somehow believe its "private"
2015-10-12 09:33:12	minimalism	These people who are against IRC for those reasons.. what do they use?
2015-10-12 09:33:34	voidead	minimalism, I guess they fart into cups tied to a string

2015-10-12 11:32:54	voidead	lol if I tried to explain what Slackware was to one of my older relatives they would just say "get a job.. why are you slacking" even though I actually have a job 
2015-10-12 11:32:56	voidead	lol
2015-10-12 11:33:32	minimalism	Yeah, it's either that or you've got the 'tism
2015-10-12 11:33:43	voidead	autism?
2015-10-12 11:34:03	minimalism	That or any other umbrella term they use for the kind of people that use these things
2015-10-12 11:34:22	voidead	yeah I really think psychologists are a joke
2015-10-12 11:34:35	voidead	psychology is a pseudo science at best
2015-10-12 11:34:49	voidead	neurology on the other hand is a real science
2015-10-12 11:34:53	minimalism	It is, but a lot of conditions still exist, even if not properly defined or understood.
2015-10-12 11:35:44	stuNNed	i find the more simple the systemd unit file the better
2015-10-12 11:36:23	voidead	the only real thing you can do is base everything on behavior.. like looking at the difference between an animal that is orange and an animal that is blue.. there is no science to it.. just arbitrary observations
2015-10-12 11:37:27	voidead	neurologists on the other hand look at the actual mechanisms at play with a diseased or impaired mind
2015-10-12 11:37:38	voidead	of course neurologists are many many years behind
2015-10-12 11:37:56	voidead	will take like 100 years to finally get the gist of the mind
2015-10-12 11:38:33	minimalism	Yeah... will take a while before we have more official classifications than autism, ocd, asperger's, schizophrenia, etc.
2015-10-12 11:38:59	minimalism	actually, not official, I should say accurate
2015-10-12 11:39:21	voidead	until then we just throw a bunch of pills at kids assuming that will do them any good
2015-10-12 11:43:29	minimalism	They should prescribe Gentoo.
2015-10-12 12:02:00	stuNNed	lol
