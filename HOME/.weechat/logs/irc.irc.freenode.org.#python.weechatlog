2014-07-10 14:33:56	Joost`	does anyone know of a nice (interactive?) tutorial that teaches the basics of Python? Something that would be suitable for people with zero programming knowledge, but sufficiently long so that even people with some minor experience in other environments might still learn something from it?
2014-07-10 14:34:22	Joost`	I'm currently looking at http://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/, but I'd prefer something that was a little more extensive

Adding a function to the classes with like serialize(self) and having that return a dict, works when there's no relationships, but as soon as there's relationships, those dont resolve that way so I still then end up with objects in that dict, that I cant call serialize on because I have no idea if they're there or even if I did, dont know how many :/

2014-07-11 03:44:35	nedbat	HowardwLo: why are you loading it 100 items at a time?  Isn't your basic operation, see if the string I have in hand is already one of the ones in the history file?

2014-07-11 06:15:26	Peng	sluidfoe: I believe Python exits with 1 if it dies due to an uncaught exception.
2014-07-11 06:15:32	buck11	sluidfoe: raise means the programmer thinks he's hit an error at that point in the code
2014-07-11 06:15:45	buck11	if nobody catches it, you'll get exit code 1 because there's an error
2014-07-11 06:15:52	buck11	Exception is just fancy speak for error

2014-07-11 06:16:36	sluidfoe	sorry, I should have given some background. I've programmed in other languages, and understand exceptions. I'm just trying to wrap my head around why I appear to be getting 0  as a return status

2014-07-11 06:17:06	Peng	sluidfoe: We don't know. That's strange. My guesses are that other code is catching the exception, or that you're mistaken about the exit status. Or possibly something weird with threading?

2014-07-06 23:26:15	rely	I wrote about a dozen, in a less intelegent way. I'm rethinking my methods now, and rewriting them.
2014-07-06 23:26:15	rely	it's a few hundred lines each nothing huge
2014-07-06 23:26:21	bob2	and how many other developers on the project are there?

2014-07-07 01:42:44	JinKazama	by this are you talking about how if this went out as a shared module to the world, it ends up in the python third-party module tree or whatever somewhere

2014-07-07 01:43:27	eevee	i assume projectDir is the root of your source tree, which is NOT the root of your python package
2014-07-07 01:43:31	eevee	which is why i added `project/`
2014-07-07 01:43:44	n1md4	hi.  how can i check an installed pip package version?
2014-07-07 01:43:53	JinKazama	it is the root of my source tree. that's not the same as root of the python package eh?

2014-07-07 01:45:06	buck11	i wish we talked about namespaces more =/
2014-07-07 01:46:06	eevee	er no.  your whole project should (usually, probably) be under one namespace.  but it's very uncommon for that to be the same directory as your source tree or repository or whatever, because then it would also contain stuff that's not part of your package, like readmes and licenses and setup.py
2014-07-07 01:46:24	eevee	e.g. https://github.com/eevee/flax where all the code is in another directory called 'flax'
2014-07-07 01:46:33	buck11	eevee: really because the name of $PWD is ill-defined on git clone

2014-07-07 01:47:05	buck11	logilab/pylint does their projects this way iirc, and it causes issues.
2014-07-07 01:47:13	eevee	their packaging is atrocious
2014-07-07 01:47:15	JinKazama	for project.etc.common, are project/etc/and common all considered "namespaces"
2014-07-07 01:47:33	buck11	project is one namespace
2014-07-07 01:47:33	eevee	logilab-common ends up as logilab.common.foo and has foo.py right in the root and it's awful.  i can't even run the tests without crazy symlink hacks
2014-07-07 01:47:37	JinKazama	i am rusty on namespaces in C++ etc
2014-07-07 01:47:47	JinKazama	ok, thanks

2014-07-12 14:32:23	nedbat	brammator: are you sure it's needed?  for example, on web sites, you don't have to log out, just walk away from the session.
2014-07-12 14:32:25	brammator	I specifically should do .Logout() or there is "phantom session" on server. too many phantom sessions == problems with next login.

2014-07-12 17:50:34	nosklo	WeiJunLi: well, that's unrelated. The error is caused by a unicode result from the selection that is not pickable, and IDLE uses pickle to show you the results in its screen. As I said, try running your code outside IDLE. IDLE is not a good python IDE, it mungles results.

2014-07-13 00:43:42	jim	gmcastil, you just draw a line, and above that line is where your callers are, and below that line are the funcs inside the class, which have access and responsibility for how the data is actually stored
2014-07-13 00:44:29	jim	above the line, has no responsibility for knowing how data is stored
2014-07-13 00:44:33	gmcastil	jim yeah, there are only a few things that i need to provide to the outside world, but generating them requires a bunch of stuff, but none of that needs to be exposed to the user

2014-07-13 01:21:14	Nemesis13	Nothing_Much: in the example of f(x)=x+1 you could do two things: you could make the function print the value and return nothing, OR you could get the return value and print that

2014-07-13 03:04:34	wlczkun	i think anyway, actually
2014-07-13 03:04:49	wlczkun	i bet tehre's a way to address the 1st .... nth sound channel without splitting them up
2014-07-13 03:05:00	pokeswap	I'll look into that. but I mostly need help getting the code to run (without taking up the screen) and to grep for mono-runtime

2014-07-13 03:06:11	wlczkun	but sound itself is also a tuple or something

2014-07-13 06:24:13	Stainedhat	no1special: scapy is pretty awesome in many regards. It'll take a bit of research to figure out the in's and out's of the protocol you want to experiment with but at the end of it you'll really understand it. Combine it with wireshark caps of your traffic and you'll know every bit and byte in no time

2014-07-13 06:25:18	no1special	i know that wireshark.org has some caps already, would you agree best to start there and dissect their examples and construct them based from these pcaps

2014-07-13 06:25:59	Stainedhat	no1special: yes, that'd be a great starting point. Scapy has decent docs so you should be able to recreate the packets after some testing. then take it from there

2014-07-13 07:13:00	Moonlightning	No, __new__() creates an instance of the /object/ of a class, and returns it.

2014-07-13 07:13:09	Moonlightning	After that, __init__() is called on the new object.
2014-07-13 07:13:21	wlczkun	init is called after..?
2014-07-13 07:13:28	Moonlightning	Yes.
2014-07-13 07:13:36	wlczkun	and associates the new object with whatever name you gave it?
2014-07-13 07:13:42	Moonlightning	No.
2014-07-13 07:13:55	Moonlightning	The binding of the object is entirely separate.
2014-07-13 07:14:03	wlczkun	what does init do?
2014-07-13 07:14:06	cjwelborn	wlczkun: http://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Metaprogramming.html#using-init-vs-new-in-metaclasses  ..i haven't read all of this but it seems to break it down just a bit.
2014-07-13 07:14:09	Moonlightning	It initializes the object.
2014-07-13 07:14:25	wlczkun	what does initializing mean in this case?
2014-07-13 07:14:32	Moonlightning	It depends on the class.
2014-07-13 07:14:38	Moonlightning	__init__() is almost always overridden in classes; __new__() is almost never.
2014-07-13 07:14:42	Moonlightning	Not that I see, anyway.
2014-07-13 07:14:47	wlczkun	hmmm
2014-07-13 07:14:57	Moonlightning	__init__() usually does the “setup” for the object, I guess.
2014-07-13 07:15:01	ssbr_at_work	wlczkun: it means mutating the instance in such a way as to give it a decent initial state

2014-07-13 07:22:34	cjwelborn	I'm not seeing why they used __new__ specifically here. I think people usually use it when they have to, because __new__ has access to things that __init__ doesn't. I think Sound() could've used __init__ just as easily, and less confusing.

2014-07-13 07:24:37	Moonlightning	If you don't override one, your class will inherit it from `object`.

2014-07-13 07:25:19	Moonlightning	Then object.__new__() gets called.
2014-07-13 07:25:19	cjwelborn	wlczkun: they can both 'initialize', but if all you're doing is initializing, it should be in __init__. If you're modifying the class itself, then __new__ could make sense.
2014-07-13 07:25:22	Moonlightning	Or object.__init__()

2014-07-13 07:36:48	Moonlightning	That's how things NORMALLY are.
2014-07-13 07:36:56	Moonlightning	But with a singleton, you want only one instance of the class ever.
2014-07-13 07:37:04	wlczkun	singleton and same_singleton are referring to the same address in memory

2014-07-13 07:48:33	wlczkun	what's the significance of samplerate=None ?
2014-07-13 07:48:34	Moonlightning	Assuming the decorator doesn't do anything weird with the arguments.

2014-07-13 07:48:47	wlczkun	i have noo idea what a decorator is
2014-07-13 07:48:51	wlczkun	i jsut know that its complicated
2014-07-13 07:48:54	Moonlightning	Mmmmm. If you don't mind me saying, I'm thinking maybe you should go through the Python tutorial.
2014-07-13 07:49:04	wlczkun	i don't mind
2014-07-13 07:49:06	wlczkun	i should
2014-07-13 07:49:20	Moonlightning	Decorators are the @ things.
2014-07-13 07:49:24	wlczkun	right i know that
2014-07-13 07:49:30	wlczkun	i found a tutorial
2014-07-13 07:49:37	wlczkun	it basically said its difficult
2014-07-13 07:49:50	wlczkun	http://simeonfranklin.com/blog/2012/jul/1/python-decorators-in-12-steps/
2014-07-13 07:50:56	Moonlightning	In a function definition, `=` like that makes keyword arguments with defaults.
2014-07-13 07:51:03	Moonlightning	They become optional.
2014-07-13 07:51:11	Moonlightning	If you don't specify them, the default is used.
2014-07-13 07:51:40	KirkMcDonald	All parameters may be passed as keyword arguments. Having a default technically has little to do with keyword arguments.
2014-07-13 07:51:46	KirkMcDonald	They just happen to go together well.
2014-07-13 07:52:14	Moonlightning	^2
2014-07-13 07:52:15	Moonlightning	This.
2014-07-13 07:52:22	Moonlightning	There's a caveat, though.
2014-07-13 07:52:36	Moonlightning	Defaults are evaulated /once/, at the time of definition.
2014-07-13 07:52:47	wlczkun	ok]
2014-07-13 07:53:06	Moonlightning	def foo(bar=[]):  # So the same list will be used each time…
2014-07-13 07:53:43	wlczkun	what would foo(bar) do
2014-07-13 07:53:51	Moonlightning	Bad example, sorry.
2014-07-13 07:54:12	Moonlightning	def foo(value, container=[]): container.append(value)

2014-07-13 07:55:02	Moonlightning	So the same container would be used each time.
2014-07-13 07:55:23	wlczkun	would you call foo like obj.foo(thing)
2014-07-13 07:55:34	Moonlightning	I mean this outside of the context of a class.
2014-07-13 07:55:35	wlczkun	and itd add it to container ?
2014-07-13 07:55:40	wlczkun	okay
2014-07-13 07:55:43	Moonlightning	foo() is just a function.
2014-07-13 07:55:53	wlczkun	if you called the function, obj was just a name
2014-07-13 07:56:16	Moonlightning	foo wouldn't normally be bound to an attribute of anything, though
2014-07-13 07:56:17	wlczkun	but ok im following
2014-07-13 07:56:53	wlczkun	so there's just one instance of container
2014-07-13 07:56:54	Moonlightning	If you want to do something like that, use None for the default instead, and check for None in the body.

2014-07-13 08:00:01	wlczkun	whats the difference between this and the earlier example?
2014-07-13 08:00:27	Moonlightning	Since the `[]` literal is in the body, it's evaluated each time the function is called.
2014-07-13 08:00:31	Moonlightning	You get a new list each time.

2014-07-13 08:03:32	wlczkun	would you do like a = foo('thing')
2014-07-13 08:03:42	Moonlightning	Sure.
2014-07-13 08:03:42	wlczkun	haha ok well its good to know how it behaves
2014-07-13 08:03:51	Moonlightning	It's not useful. Just an example to explain…how it behaves, yeah.
2014-07-13 08:04:12	Moonlightning	You do see tuples used as defaults sometimes, though
2014-07-13 08:04:26	Moonlightning	More specifically, the empty tuple. /The/ empty tuple. Tuples are immutable.
2014-07-13 08:04:36	Moonlightning	And I think the empty tuple is actually a singleton.

2014-07-13 08:06:59	wlczkun	immutable means you can't change it i thought?
2014-07-13 08:07:12	wlczkun	so you could have tuples with just a value 'a' inside of them, like a bunch fo them
2014-07-13 08:07:39	wlczkun	but i guess what is the difference between a singleton and those? they are all identical and immutable but might take up more memory

2014-07-13 08:08:55	Moonlightning	Yeah, that's what immutable means

2014-07-13 09:19:04	Meriipu	if I have a gameplayer object that usually is initialized by being passed a **dict, should I just skip unpacking the dict and instead go by self.dict[attr] or even just self[attr] whenever accessing attributes? I need to return a dictionary for dumping to json anyways, and I also sometimes need the field names like 'name', but it intuitively sounds a bit weird to use dictionary lookups instead of accessing attributes for stuff related to the gameplayer

2014-07-13 09:30:42	Meriipu	 I have a similar issue with the class representing a game where I do not know if I should make individual instance attributes, or whether I should put the stuff in a single dictionary. Originally the objects are created from a parsed logfile, but after that can be dumped to a json dictionary and game objects instantiated again later from the dictionary http://bpaste.net/show/anGs2wR3enLQAxgKVlni/ but I just feel more confused about what might be a goo
2014-07-13 09:31:27	Meriipu	it seems like additional steps to unpack the dictionary, but is not reading straight from a dictionary potentially a bit untidy too?

2014-07-13 14:53:29	\u03b5	then it needs to be either a method if used by the instance, or a class method if used from outside the class; if you make an internal method a plain function, someone who subclasses you might be forced to break your expectations

2014-07-28 13:29:48	Guest75683	Hey guys, I've got a question: I'm trying to program a network interface, but haven't done that before thou. I've got that far for now: http://ideone.com/AJM0w3 The server is listening, the client is connecting. But I'm instancing server and client out of a gui driven applicatoin. When starting the application twice (once for server, once for client) they both freeze as soon as establishing the connection, thus I wanted to put the
2014-07-28 13:30:08	Guest75683	in the background. I don't know how to establish that thou. Does anybody have an idea how to manage this?

2014-07-28 13:31:04	CatKiller	Guest75683: You're not going to like the answer: You should use a network library like Twisted to do that

2014-07-28 13:31:54	cdunklau	Guest75683: network programming is *hard*. Twisted does the hard parts for you
2014-07-28 13:31:57	Kwpolska	Guest75683: do not use socket, ever.  (also, it’s “though”; “thou” is an older form for “you”)

2014-07-28 13:32:28	Guest75683	well ok, so Twisted kind of takes care of all the necessities?

2014-07-28 13:35:42	stangeland	Why is it actually that it is good to do class myclass(object): instead of class myclass: when defining a new object? Is it just because of explitcitness?
2014-07-28 13:35:48	asdf`	cdunklau, getting support on channels like #python is harder when your code is in german :)
2014-07-28 13:35:54	vywern	Do Python dict[key] lookups work faster than enumerating an array of (key, value) tuples?
