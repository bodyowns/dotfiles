2014-11-13 05:26:58	ShawnR	so which .deb do I need to download for the weechat-devel 1.1-1?
2014-11-13 05:27:53	ShawnR	I am an impatient man and I will eventually use git (maybe), but for now, I just want to dpkg it on here :)

2014-11-13 05:28:30	gb	ShawnR: to install dev deb you need to unionstall stable deb
2014-11-13 05:28:42	ShawnR	right, but which .deb do I pick?
2014-11-13 05:28:56	ShawnR	weechat-devel-core, weechat-devel-curses?
2014-11-13 05:29:19	ShawnR	i'm used to just seeing 1 deb i need to DL, not 7 to choose from
2014-11-13 05:29:34	gb	add the right line to sources.list and apt-get install weechat-dev weechat-dev-plugins i think
2014-11-13 05:30:07	ShawnR	the right line, eh?
2014-11-13 05:30:56	gb	or better yet add a src line to sources.list; leave your stable alone; apt-get update; apt-get build-dep weechat-dev; mkdir src;cd src; git clone...
2014-11-13 05:31:30	ShawnR	gb but which line? I don't see what line to add to the sources.list for wheezy
2014-11-13 05:31:31	gb	not precise commands but should be enough for you to find precise stuff without my typoes throughout
2014-11-13 05:32:11	ShawnR	oh... i'm a tard
2014-11-13 05:32:27	ShawnR	weechat-dev is avail, i shoulda just done that from the begining
2014-11-13 05:32:29	gb	i use sid not wheezy
2014-11-13 05:33:06	gb	but if you install packages you also need plugins either via apt or .deb
2014-11-13 05:33:24	gb	the -dev plugins not stable
2014-11-13 05:34:02	ShawnR	cool, thanks
2014-11-13 05:34:10	ShawnR	i was informed last time i should not do a /quit
2014-11-13 05:34:20	gb	correct
2014-11-13 05:34:23	ShawnR	how should i close out weechad stable before i remove and ugprade to weechat dev?
2014-11-13 05:34:30	gb	you do not
2014-11-13 05:34:32	ShawnR	weechad? lol
2014-11-13 05:34:50	gb	install packages then inside weechat after plugins/everything installed /upgrade
2014-11-13 05:35:25	gb	it is safe to uninstall stable while it is running
2014-11-13 05:35:35	gb	at least tht is what i did

2014-11-13 05:38:30	ShawnR	ok so just jump out of the screen, apt-get remove weechat then apt-get install weechat-dev and weechat-plugins-dev (or whatever the plugins dev is)?
2014-11-13 05:38:39	gb	an upgrade will force ssl to disconnect/reconnect but aside from that you should remain connected the whole time to all your servers

2014-11-13 05:39:57	gb	if you use aptitude and install weechat-dev-plugins it should remove all the old stuff for you and grab weechat-curses, etc
2014-11-13 05:41:01	gb	i'm not too sure on the precise names of pacages though, been using git forever now :)
2014-11-13 05:41:18	ShawnR	maybe i can learn git'
2014-11-13 05:41:45	ShawnR	i'm just trying to troubleshoot my wife's network issues and I can't find any good lantest tools that are cross platform, so i'm learning how to get winders installed in KVM
2014-11-13 05:41:49	gb	git is much easier once it is all installed for upgrading
2014-11-13 05:41:53	ShawnR	i fear i'll never have my head on straight
2014-11-13 05:42:12	gb	can be a lil tricky to setup chown files for make install to work as a user
2014-11-13 05:42:35	ShawnR	but if i make install as root, i can then run as user, right?
2014-11-13 05:42:45	gb	but once done it's very nice
2014-11-13 05:43:23	gb	you could but it's messier
2014-11-13 05:43:51	ShawnR	messier as root than as user? i'll take your word for it
2014-11-13 05:43:57	ShawnR	no need to take a look (b/c it's in a book)
2014-11-13 05:44:23	gb	not easier/or harder, but less likely to destroy your system as a user :)
2014-11-13 05:44:34	ShawnR	oh
2014-11-13 05:44:41	ShawnR	I don't care :) this VM is specifically a "weechat" VM
2014-11-13 05:44:51	ShawnR	it has weechat and eggdrop installed. that's it
2014-11-13 05:46:03	gb	my aliases run as the user, to run make install you'd need to setup sudo to run make install as root which i think is a bad idea from weechat
2014-11-13 05:46:37	ShawnR	aliases? as in so you just do the whole thing from within weechat?
2014-11-13 05:46:46	gb	yup
2014-11-13 05:47:04	gb	not the mkdir, intial git clone, etc
2014-11-13 05:47:12	gb	just the make install
2014-11-13 05:47:18	ShawnR	that's still pretty cool
2014-11-13 05:47:33	ShawnR	I don't mind dropping to shell to do that stuff
2014-11-13 05:49:06	gb	my alias with special source(o)/alias git /exec -sw -name gitbuild -n -sh cd ~/src/weechat/build && git pull && ding && o git pull finished && sleep 300 && make clean && rm CMakeCache.txt && time make -j 2 install && o git build completed successfully || o git build failed && date
2014-11-13 05:49:42	ShawnR	that's the reason i don't really like messing with git.  i haven't had time to dig into it THAT much
2014-11-13 05:49:46	gb	it will work in stable but not .4.4 or older
2014-11-13 05:50:00	ShawnR	other than the few copy/paste jobs, i havent' done make make install since 2000 in an intro to C class in college
2014-11-13 05:50:32	gb	well you will still need to build-dep with a src line for weechat-dev when you do go to git from dev packages
2014-11-13 05:51:14	gb	the issues are the same regardless of what version/release you go to git from
2014-11-13 05:51:16	ShawnR	ah... that's nice
2014-11-13 05:51:31	ShawnR	i just did the whole /key missing thing to get the Bare view working
2014-11-13 05:51:50	ShawnR	so much nicer for copying those stupid long URLs and quotes
2014-11-13 05:52:08	gb	hahaha
2014-11-13 05:52:30	gb	or you can use glowing-bear in a web browser
2014-11-13 05:53:24	gb	ie no ncurses, dunno about qt version of weechat though
2014-11-13 05:54:28	gb	i'd imagine the whole wrapping issue would disappear in that as well maybe but yes my aliases are insanely long :)

2014-11-13 05:58:50	gb	if on ms i use mobaxterm which includes an x11 server and just run konsole over it so it's the same as being logged into my machine but having a putty session open for the ctrl g's is handy

2014-11-13 06:01:34	ShawnR	i replaced putty with kitty, but i think orig. just b/c of the clicky URLs or something
