2014-06-07 00:19:07	+Mous	because this problem is similar i saw with motherboard and PSU
2014-06-07 00:19:16	+amews_aj	Maybe try video output on motherboard rather than dedicated graphics.

2014-06-07 00:20:04	+Mous	i dont think its gpu
2014-06-07 00:20:19	body	but the powersupply can be broken, if my ram gets voltage,my hdd also, my fans, my leds in the front, neon , 
2014-06-07 00:20:20	+amews_aj	Mous: but could be PSU power for GPU
2014-06-07 00:20:29	body	nono i changed 2 GPU-s
2014-06-07 00:20:35	+Mous	then it would not shut down on its own
2014-06-07 00:20:57	+amews_aj	If a failure occured in the PSU it would I believe ?
2014-06-07 00:21:22	+Mous	yep in PSU but not in GPU
2014-06-07 00:21:24	body	i powerd on my pc, saw the boot screen, than shutdown, and after, when i re powerd on, no display, but the components in were working
2014-06-07 00:24:53	+Mous	but still these are just blind shots
2014-06-07 00:26:53	body	the jumper thing to switch it from 1-2 pin to 2-3 pin , than back i should do it with the power supply attached to the electricity ? 
2014-06-07 00:27:02	body	or disconnect the electricity cable ?
2014-06-07 00:27:32	+Mous	you mean to reset CMOS?
2014-06-07 00:27:38	+Mous	take out the battery
2014-06-07 00:27:57	body	it's the same as switching the jumper ?

2014-06-07 00:57:51	Mah-jonng	Have been using Bing, DuckDuckGo and Google for the last 2 hours plus trying to find a Vista Registry 'fix' or hack to completely stop the "Windows has blocked startup programs" message appearing. I only want to stop that message appearing and not other messages appearing!
2014-06-07 00:58:01	Mah-jonng	So, the question is: can anyone provide me with a 'fix', hack or link to a website to be able to do what I have just mentioned?

2014-06-07 01:04:17	&BladeZephon	but, one solution would be to figure out which program it's blocking and either stop said program from starting automatically
2014-06-07 01:04:20	&BladeZephon	or
2014-06-07 01:04:27	&BladeZephon	allow the program to start

2014-06-07 01:05:38	&BladeZephon	what you're looking for is a way to suppress the problem, which is dangerous because it takes away potentially useful diagnostic information.  Better just to fix the problem at the source
2014-06-07 01:12:22	+JayTee84	Mous.. That issue with that dudes external WD hard drive yesterday. I'm havign the same issue today

2014-06-07 02:29:54	@Coffee	your reputation for being demanding and impatient preceeds you, as well as your tendancy to ignore or contradict the advice that is given; as such few of our volunteers are eager to try to help you
2014-06-07 02:30:32	&myrti	1. you are not guaranteed an answer
2014-06-07 02:30:52	&myrti	2. if you've been waiting for an hour and nobody has answered you can assume that either noone wants to answer you or noone knows the answer
2014-06-07 02:31:22	&myrti	3. trying to put a time limit in which poeple have to  answer your question is not improving things

2014-06-07 05:39:00	Liam_W	Or can duel cores produce the same power/performance?
2014-06-07 05:40:06	@Legion	it depends on the task

2014-06-07 05:40:18	&myrti	..
2014-06-07 05:40:37	@Legion	some tasks can't be shared between multiple cores so even a quad core acts like a single core

2014-06-07 05:43:23	@Legion	for things like photoshop and IDEs a quad core will help, but the real bottleneck tends to be the hard drive
2014-06-07 05:43:51	Liam_W	I see, well I was thinking a small SSD for the OS install and software/games.
2014-06-07 05:44:08	⚡	Legion recommends it
2014-06-07 05:44:08	Liam_W	128GB SSD or something
2014-06-07 05:44:17	Liam_W	Then a 1TB hybrid as secondary
2014-06-07 05:44:23	Liam_W	for files so on

2014-06-07 05:44:43	@Legion	I just got my first SSD a few months ago (128GB) and the difference is amazing
2014-06-07 05:44:58	+Mintmayan	I'd go for a 250/256 GB SSD because it fills up rapidly with modern games taking up 10-30 GB easily
2014-06-07 05:45:04	@Legion	definately
2014-06-07 05:45:26	+Mintmayan	and you will want to have at least a couple of games take advantage of the SSD while the rest sits on a different (traditional) drive
2014-06-07 05:45:29	Liam_W	I would have, But the only game I play on the PC is "Football Manager" the rest i play on the PS4.
