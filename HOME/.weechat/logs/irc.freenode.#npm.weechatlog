2015-04-15 05:04:23	body	hello, why when i try to use node i get a lot of errors, and only when i use it with sudo i don't get any errors
2015-04-15 05:04:25	body	?
2015-04-15 05:04:38	Aria	That depends on what you're doing with node.
2015-04-15 05:04:55	Aria	Writing to files owned by other users and binding ports < 1024 does require root privilege.
2015-04-15 05:04:58	body	Aria: for example i wanted to do : npm update -g bower
2015-04-15 05:05:02	terinjokes	iarna: thanks for the reply, installing it now
2015-04-15 05:05:24	Aria	body: On most systems, they assume that /usr/local/ will be shared between users, so it's owned by root, so you need sudo to write to it.
2015-04-15 05:05:29	body	Aria: so i had to do sudo npm update -g bower
2015-04-15 05:05:41	Aria	body: However, on a single-user system, it makes sense to chown -R youruser /usr/local often
2015-04-15 05:05:52	Aria	that way you won't need sudo, it's just your space in the first place.
2015-04-15 05:06:22	terinjokes	iarna: you have any ideas why 'fetchPackageMetaData' was going against registry.npmjs.org, when 'mapToRegistry' uses registry.npmjs.cf?
2015-04-15 05:06:30	terinjokes	was the other weird output i was getting
2015-04-15 05:07:01	body	Aria: yea, i had to chown it, thank you very much for this :)
2015-04-15 05:07:08	Aria	You are welcome.
