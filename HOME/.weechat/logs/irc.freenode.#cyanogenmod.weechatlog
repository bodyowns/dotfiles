While I do get LTE, I cannot send/receive texts (either with the default texting app or Hangouts).  Nothing more than "could not send".  This is after the Ting APN .zip was loaded (which did restore my ability to get LTE, but has "wierd" settings in the APN page)

2015-03-03 01:54:45	DiscipleOfDante	And they are looking at using it for getting rid of land-fills with the bacteria
2015-03-03 01:54:47	pagefault	like I said
2015-03-03 01:54:48	pagefault	it’s not for kids
2015-03-03 01:54:54	DiscipleOfDante	Tobias[L]: Yeah but that isn't what I use my phone for
2015-03-03 01:55:04	DiscipleOfDante	Well not all I use my phone for
2015-03-03 01:55:08	GTRsdk	DiscipleOfDante, did you know that some plastics will degrade if left in sunlight or extreme temperatures too long?
2015-03-03 01:55:41	DiscipleOfDante	GTRsdk: Yep
2015-03-03 01:55:47	DiscipleOfDante	Trash bags especially like to tdo that
2015-03-03 01:56:00	DiscipleOfDante	Eventually they will break down completely
2015-03-03 01:56:10	Tobias[L]	DiscipleOfDante: thats why you will get carpal tunnel syndrome and need the one you have but will never be satisfied with the keyboard
2015-03-03 01:56:33	Flacko	Hmm
2015-03-03 01:56:35	GTRsdk	PLA does that when you don't want it to :<

2015-03-03 01:57:29	Flacko	I don't know what to do, body. You could try flashing a different kitkat ROM first and then go over to CM11
2015-03-03 01:57:50	pagefault	bynarie: it’s much better with cm12 though isn’t it
2015-03-03 01:58:13	bynarie	absolutely pagefault
2015-03-03 01:58:35	pagefault	and mostly everything works
2015-03-03 01:58:35	bynarie	pagefault, u dont happen to have your cm12 build on a server anywhere to download do you?
2015-03-03 01:58:37	DiscipleOfDante	The hardware on the Q10 isn't too terribly bad though
2015-03-03 01:58:38	body	Flacko: yea...it's ok, i just wanted to turn back at a lower version because cm12 it's draining my battery like ***
2015-03-03 01:58:47	DiscipleOfDante	It is comparable to my SGSIII
2015-03-03 01:58:51	GTRsdk	omg I just realized... the sim card plastic around the card that people put into the early smartphones actually makes up a full size sim
2015-03-03 01:58:53	Flacko	=/
2015-03-03 01:59:02	pagefault	bynarie: not currently I haven’t build one in a while
2015-03-03 01:59:10	bynarie	ah.. ok
2015-03-03 01:59:18	bynarie	but yea overall its a great tablet

2015-03-03 01:59:35	bynarie	yep
2015-03-03 01:59:37	bynarie	i hope so
2015-03-03 01:59:56	pagefault	another great hardware ruined by shitty samsung software
2015-03-03 02:00:08	bynarie	lol no doubt... i hate touchwiz crap
2015-03-03 02:00:34	bynarie	i still cannot get over the colors and display, how vivid and deep they are, its absolutely amazing
