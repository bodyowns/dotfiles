2014-06-04 23:30:33	syphter	honestly a global currency would fix alot of issues, namely conversion exploitation where you trade in your currency for another right before there is an increase in the other that makes it more valuable than yours ( then you just swap back when the inverse is true increasing your profit )
2014-06-04 23:30:50	diegoviola	indeed
2014-06-04 23:31:21	diegoviola	just like the internet fixed many things
2014-06-04 23:31:32	diegoviola	communication being one of then
2014-06-04 23:31:37	diegoviola	them*
2014-06-04 23:31:41	syphter	not to mention would countries would no longer face hyper inflation/deflation so recession would be less severe
2014-06-04 23:31:54	diegoviola	yeah
2014-06-04 23:32:12	JohnDory	who would determine this global currency? Would this replace the local currencies? What would they do when they need to devalue they currency to change local pricing strategies in markets?

2014-06-04 23:32:45	diegoviola	we need to take power away from the few and give them back to people
2014-06-04 23:33:07	JohnDory	and how will that be achieved?

2014-06-04 23:33:57	syphter	JohnDory: obviously some international group, deflation would occur based on the issued amount of currency, currency devalues both when their is too much and over enough time due to how people feel about money (ie their leeway on purchasing something) 
2014-06-04 23:34:05	diegoviola	through things they cannot control, cryptography, etc

2014-06-04 23:35:14	JohnDory	syphter: you do understand that countries use currency to allow them to export goods, if they stop printing money and the currency slow increases in value, then the products they wish to export inflate in price

2014-06-07 22:58:54	Desu	Arch-TK: if you ask a C coder to debug a large C project you will get the same result
2014-06-07 22:59:00	Desu	:p
2014-06-07 22:59:07	Arch-TK	Yeah, well that's why you don't debug minecraft.
2014-06-07 22:59:11	Hwkiller	like i said, I like C as a language, I just don't think i'd want to spend the time actually using it.

2014-06-07 22:59:14	Hwkiller	love the concepts though.
2014-06-07 22:59:21	Arch-TK	Because if someone who doesn't know C, sits down and writes minecraft in C.
2014-06-07 22:59:27	Arch-TK	And then you ask anyone to debug it.
2014-06-07 22:59:28	buhman	Arch-TK: you've seen me in -botabuse, I don't curse *that* much do I? ;p

2014-06-07 23:00:38	Arch-TK	Desu: This is why a sensible C programmer will take time every day or so, to take a few hours and make sure everything works.
2014-06-07 23:01:00	Arch-TK	And not just steam onwards as long as things "kind of work"
2014-06-07 23:01:35	Arch-TK	You will get the same debugging problems in ANY language if you're a muppet and don't understand the importance of keeping a hold of your bugs.
2014-06-07 23:01:37	Desu	Arch-TK: I've literally waited months for a team of more than 20 people to debug a "simple" error in C
2014-06-07 23:01:59	Desu	Arch-TK: and these are not just random noobs
2014-06-07 23:02:07	Arch-TK	Desu: Is the project open source?
2014-06-07 23:02:12	Desu	but people writing pabx software, with more than 20 year experience
2014-06-07 23:02:23	Arch-TK	Yes and?
2014-06-07 23:02:33	Arch-TK	Big projects + small errors = big bugs.
2014-06-07 23:02:36	Arch-TK	That's expected.
2014-06-07 23:02:51	Arch-TK	You can't say the same for python because most the time, nobody bothers writing big things in python.
2014-06-07 23:03:03	Desu	except that people do
2014-06-07 23:03:11	Arch-TK	Most the time, someone wants to glue some input to some output, and do it in a night, and get shit done.
2014-06-07 23:03:29	Arch-TK	Sure, use python, if you know all of its functions from top to bottom.

2014-06-07 23:04:01	Arch-TK	But you can't tell me that python is "magical" and that every small bug in your python code can be magically fixed by a once-over on the code.
2014-06-07 23:04:03	Desu	the python core is actually really small
2014-06-07 23:04:11	Desu	Arch-TK: I never claimed that
2014-06-07 23:04:25	Arch-TK	I can't define "it is functions" because that's not english.
2014-06-07 23:04:27	Hwkiller	well, and debugging python is easy /if only/ because it has built-in methods for handling errors.
2014-06-07 23:04:45	buhman	erm
2014-06-07 23:04:48	buhman	wat
2014-06-07 23:04:48	Hwkiller	not that you can't do the same in C, and not that everyone /uses/ them, but you at least have a standard way of catching errors and acting on them.
2014-06-07 23:05:06	Hwkiller	try: except:
2014-06-07 23:05:07	Arch-TK	Hwkiller: Some #include <assert.h> and gcc -g will do the trick for you.
2014-06-07 23:05:10	buhman	there is a standard way
2014-06-07 23:05:24	buhman	ret = foo(); if (ret < 0) perror();
2014-06-07 23:05:27	buhman	pretty simple

2014-06-07 23:05:56	Arch-TK	I switched from java to C one day, and never even stopped to wonder how important exceptions were.
2014-06-07 23:06:10	Arch-TK	There are just other ways of dealing with these things.
2014-06-07 23:06:41	buhman	or hell, you could even raise(SIGINT), step, and backtrace in gdb
2014-06-07 23:06:42	Arch-TK	Sure, you have to stay alert, but it keeps people from just doing a java in the end and putting a try block around all their code.
2014-06-07 23:06:51	buhman	this isn't rocket science.
2014-06-07 23:07:03	Arch-TK	And then a e.printStackTrace() at the end.
2014-06-07 23:07:28	Hwkiller	i never said you /couldn'/ catch errors; i meant that python makes it a bit easier
2014-06-07 23:07:34	buhman	I disagree completely.
2014-06-07 23:07:44	Arch-TK	No it doesn't, on that front I think C makes it just as easy.
2014-06-07 23:08:10	Arch-TK	PHP, sure, PHP is a horrible mess of a language.
2014-06-07 23:08:14	Hwkiller	really? "try: something; except: something else" is not easier than manually implementing the logic?
2014-06-07 23:08:16	Arch-TK	You can't debug that unless you put a gun to your head.
2014-06-07 23:08:31	buhman	so what is it that 'something else' is?
2014-06-07 23:08:31	Arch-TK	Hwkiller: You don't need to manually implement the logic.
2014-06-07 23:08:37	buhman	it's the verbatim exact same logic
2014-06-07 23:08:48	Arch-TK	There are just other ways of doing it.
2014-06-07 23:09:27	Arch-TK	you can do what you want, you can printf() all your variables, assert() the variables, you can implement complex behaviour using setjmp.h
2014-06-07 23:09:52	buhman	except the C logic is less obtuse.

2014-06-18 22:33:36	diegoviola	the windows guy
2014-06-18 22:33:48	diegoviola	i asked him to switch to linux so he can actually do the rails development sanely
2014-06-18 22:33:52	diegoviola	then he says he doesn't want to install linux
2014-06-18 22:34:01	diegoviola	i point him to install a virtual machine with linux, he installs it
2014-06-18 22:34:05	diegoviola	now he's asking me to install rails for him
2014-06-18 22:34:16	diegoviola	i said "start ssh and give me your IP and root password"
2014-06-18 22:34:18	brainwave	diegoviola: what happened?
2014-06-18 22:34:27	diegoviola	he's saying now "install teamviewer"
2014-06-18 22:34:30	diegoviola	fuck
2014-06-18 22:34:33	diegoviola	"access via teamweaver"
2014-06-18 22:34:37	diegoviola	i don't want to install that piece of shit
2014-06-18 22:34:54	mankypirate	teamviewer is pretty much the best remote support tool
2014-06-18 22:35:16	brainwave	team viewer is stupid bloatware.
2014-06-18 22:35:27	brainwave	mankypirate: although you are right :-/
2014-06-18 22:35:50	syphter	teamviewer is nice imho but its proprietary and ssh is really all you need to install packages remotely
2014-06-18 22:35:52	brainwave	Do you guys know whats wrong in using VLC for playing audio files?
2014-06-18 22:36:16	mankypirate	brainwave: why would there be something wrong about that?
2014-06-18 22:36:25	syphter	brainwave: other than its kind of a waste to load a gui to just play audio files I don't know
2014-06-18 22:36:48	syphter	I use ncmpcpp + mpd for audio and vlc for video

2014-06-18 22:38:48	brainwave	There exist so many specialized media players, VLC plays just fine.
2014-06-18 22:38:49	brainwave	mankypirate: I am on mac os x right now, and there isn't really any good alternative to itunes they say. I am wondering if I am missing something with VLC
2014-06-18 22:38:49	brainwave	They also say we need something like VLC for audio, on some forums. I thought VLC played audio just fine!
2014-06-18 22:38:59	syphter	diegoviola: I guess he doesn't trust you enough to give out his ip but trusts you enough to not do rm -rf / ?

2014-06-18 23:24:53	brainwave	Ha Ha
2014-06-18 23:24:56	brainwave	What do you do for a living?
2014-06-18 23:25:00	Arch-TK	brainwave: Imagine if I installed some kind of backdoor remote access.
2014-06-18 23:25:04	brainwave	(if you dont mine)
2014-06-18 23:25:05	brainwave	*mind
2014-06-18 23:25:08	Arch-TK	brainwave: I'm 17, I don't have a living to do for.
2014-06-18 23:25:22	Arch-TK	brainwave: I did just apply for an apprenticeship.
2014-06-18 23:25:29	Arch-TK	At a company which does a lot of stuff with raspberry pis.
2014-06-18 23:25:35	brainwave	So I had this nice thing going in college. 
2014-06-18 23:25:40	syphter	Arch-TK: hit up the jobs while your in school brother its easier than applying out with zero experience
2014-06-18 23:25:43	Arch-TK	So they asked for C, Linux, Python and Raspberry Pi experience.
2014-06-18 23:25:51	brainwave	People with fedora would ask how the heck do I add myself to sudoers now?
2014-06-18 23:26:00	brainwave	And i had a better reply than 'google it'
2014-06-18 23:26:04	brainwave	I used to ask their computer
2014-06-18 23:26:13	Arch-TK	brainwave: ?
2014-06-18 23:26:15	brainwave	:D Guess who set the su password
2014-06-18 23:26:16	brainwave	:D
2014-06-18 23:26:19	brainwave	3:-)
2014-06-18 23:26:25	Arch-TK	.
2014-06-18 23:26:26	brainwave	So they got sudo all right
2014-06-18 23:26:28	Arch-TK	...
2014-06-18 23:26:30	Arch-TK	W..
2014-06-18 23:26:32	Arch-TK	Wha?
2014-06-18 23:26:44	brainwave	Yup. I had all their root passwords. 
2014-06-18 23:26:47	Arch-TK	So you gave them sudo, then you changed their root passwords?
2014-06-18 23:26:51	brainwave	Like some 20-30 people
2014-06-18 23:26:58	brainwave	Yeah. They got sudo all right.
2014-06-18 23:27:05	brainwave	I got set the root passwords to my own wish.
2014-06-18 23:27:11	brainwave	Bums wouldn't ever notice lol
2014-06-18 23:27:46	syphter	kinda pointless if you don't know where its being used 
2014-06-18 23:28:02	Arch-TK	syphter: Set them all to one password.
2014-06-18 23:28:05	Arch-TK	Meet someone you recognise.
2014-06-18 23:28:12	Arch-TK	They go off to do something random and leave their laptop.
2014-06-18 23:28:18	Arch-TK	su
2014-06-18 23:28:36	brainwave	Well I could do a lot of thigns with that su.
2014-06-18 23:28:37	Arch-TK	rm -rf --no-preserve-root /
2014-06-18 23:28:55	brainwave	For one, there was unrestricted internet access to one particular bunch of designers of my college
2014-06-18 23:29:23	brainwave	Even in labs with no internet, these guys would ssh into a server, with their laptops
2014-06-18 23:29:32	syphter	Arch-TK: I'm saying if you don't know where their laptop is at or what network its own its pointless to set the root password to something with the intent of using it as a backdoor
2014-06-18 23:29:40	brainwave	And then execute a 'script' for internet access on their browser
2014-06-18 23:29:46	Arch-TK	syphter: ...???
2014-06-18 23:29:49	brainwave	It was just setting a proxy really.
2014-06-18 23:29:52	Arch-TK	syphter: Who said anything about backdoors?
2014-06-18 23:30:02	brainwave	But here's the fun part. With these people's su passowrd, I got their private keys.
2014-06-18 23:30:08	Arch-TK	syphter: I mentioned it when talking about porttforwarding shit for windows users.
2014-06-18 23:30:11	diegoviola	So I just told the guy to forward his port on his router and now he's like "I'm at the company, I don't have access to the router"
2014-06-18 23:30:14	diegoviola	DAMN
2014-06-18 23:30:50	brainwave	diegoviola: awesome
2014-06-18 23:30:58	brainwave	You need a coffee break.
2014-06-18 23:31:19	diegoviola	black or expresso?
2014-06-18 23:31:23	syphter	diegoviola: uhh ask them to forward the port? or just install teamviewer yes you don't want it I know but you've hit a brick wall
2014-06-18 23:31:29	diegoviola	what do you guys like
2014-06-18 23:31:33	syphter	black
2014-06-18 23:31:40	diegoviola	nice
2014-06-18 23:31:43	brainwave	Neither. Tea.
2014-06-18 23:31:50	brainwave	Nice, good old Tea.
2014-06-18 23:31:54	syphter	unless its shit coffee then shit load of coffee and creamer
2014-06-18 23:32:20	diegoviola	maybe i'll reboot to some live usb and install teamviewer there
2014-06-18 23:32:27	diegoviola	so i don't have to screw with my install
2014-06-18 23:32:30	syphter	which imho only imported coffee is good enough to drink black 
2014-06-18 23:32:55	syphter	diegoviola: AUR I think has a package for it then just pacman -S AUR packagename 
2014-06-18 23:33:05	syphter	err pacman -R aur Packagename
2014-06-18 23:33:16	brainwave	diegoviola: you on arch?
2014-06-18 23:33:20	diegoviola	yeah
2014-06-18 23:33:26	brainwave	If yes, then you ought to abuse pacman's awesome capabilites

2014-06-18 23:33:46	brainwave	And install and uninstall with ease
2014-06-18 23:33:55	diegoviola	what amazes me is that these guys are so lazy or lacking in skills, how did they get their job in the first place?
2014-06-18 23:34:02	syphter	indeed 
2014-06-18 23:34:12	diegoviola	or how are they able to keep their jobs?
2014-06-18 23:34:13	diegoviola	damn
2014-06-18 23:34:14	syphter	probably knew somebody who knew somebody I guess

2014-06-27 23:32:54	dagle	Arch-TK: Have you done templetes in C++?
2014-06-27 23:33:06	Arch-TK	dagle: I've never done a line of C++ in my life.
2014-06-27 23:33:10	Arch-TK	I don't know the language either.
2014-06-27 23:33:13	Arch-TK	So no.
2014-06-27 23:33:55	dagle	Arch-TK: Well, when you templetes and it starts to generate code and that code doesn't compile and you get 20 pages of errors and none of the errors is from the code you have written... that's when you get mad at c++.
2014-06-27 23:34:02	dagle	you use*
2014-06-27 23:34:18	Arch-TK	dagle: I wasn't meaning to imply that C++ is a good language.
2014-06-27 23:34:22	Arch-TK	But I can see your point.
2014-06-27 23:34:30	Arch-TK	That sounds like a really silly behaviour.
2014-06-27 23:34:52	dagle	That is something C doesn't do in general, if you don't abuse the macrosystem until you should get killed.
2014-06-27 23:35:01	mankypirate	I don't know anything about c++ but I know enough that I'll never use it
2014-06-27 23:35:40	Arch-TK	dagle: Of course, until you include a headerfile with a missing ; and the error appears in the sourcefile (but that's generally pretty easy to spot)
2014-06-27 23:35:51	Arch-TK	(I seem to miss ; a lot. I blame python and lua.
2014-06-27 23:36:04	mankypirate	fortunately you don't write lisp
2014-06-27 23:36:05	Arch-TK	I also seem to add ; to python and lua scripts accidentaly too.)
2014-06-27 23:36:06	mankypirate	dat missing paren
2014-06-27 23:36:20	MrElendig	Arch-TK: that is why you should use syntastic
2014-06-27 23:36:20	Arch-TK	mankypirate: I was doing multiline parentheses.
2014-06-27 23:36:27	Arch-TK	syntastic?
2014-06-27 23:36:45	MrElendig	or are you one of those religious nutters?
2014-06-27 23:36:46	eto	wat the fuck is with this new sexist shit thing?
2014-06-27 23:36:46	Arch-TK	MrElendig: Oh this.
2014-06-27 23:37:12	MrElendig	that uses emacs
2014-06-27 23:37:12	Arch-TK	I have YouCompleteMe, which when set up correctly, runs clang in the background to give you live error checking.
2014-06-27 23:37:26	Arch-TK	MrElendig: I'm not woddf2 no.
2014-06-27 23:37:34	eto	every assholes now writes about sexism in games, sexism in IT, sexism here and there
2014-06-27 23:37:45	MrElendig	eto: maybe because it is a real problem
2014-06-27 23:37:46	woddf2	Arch-TK: I'm not religious about it.
2014-06-27 23:37:50	eto	wat's going on, is there some new sexism trend or wat?
2014-06-27 23:37:52	Arch-TK	woddf2: I was joking.
2014-06-27 23:37:56	MrElendig	eto: but no, it must be a conspiracy!
2014-06-27 23:37:59	mankypirate	eto: yeah that's really stupid shit
2014-06-27 23:38:00	woddf2	Arch-TK: I know.  (I honestly don't mind vi, though.)
2014-06-27 23:38:14	⚡	woddf2 dodges flying objects from fellow Emacs users who are more zealous than him
2014-06-27 23:38:16	MrElendig	eto: ALL THE GAY NAZI FEMITARD ANIENT ALIENS!
2014-06-27 23:38:16	eto	MrElendig: seems like good googlebait
2014-06-27 23:38:29	Arch-TK	MrElendig: It's not really a problem, you can't tell a company to stop targeting its target audience.
2014-06-27 23:38:36	eto	MrElendig: more like people being shallow tools of vanity
2014-06-27 23:38:39	MrElendig	Arch-TK: it is a real problem
2014-06-27 23:38:49	Arch-TK	MrElendig: In games, people might complain they make women look weak and make men save them a lot or something silly.
2014-06-27 23:38:54	Arch-TK	Firstly, this doesn't happen all that much.
2014-06-27 23:39:08	eto	MrElendig: it wasn't a problem till that github bitch and someshit before
2014-06-27 23:39:12	Arch-TK	Secondly, you might as well ask women's magazines to target men more because otherwise it's sexist.
2014-06-27 23:39:14	MrElendig	Arch-TK: many IT companies are really female hostile
2014-06-27 23:39:16	eto	now it asploded like bomb
2014-06-27 23:39:26	Arch-TK	A comapny has a target audience, and the product has to appeal to that target audience to sell.
2014-06-27 23:39:42	eto	are peoeple really only google+blogo trend whores now?
2014-06-27 23:39:47	Arch-TK	If they make a game about how girls bead up lots of men, I doubt the game will be as successful with men.
2014-06-27 23:39:48	eto	such fail
2014-06-27 23:39:52	MrElendig	Arch-TK: sexual harrasment is often the norm instead of the exception etc
2014-06-27 23:40:01	MrElendig	Arch-TK: so is discrimination
2014-06-27 23:40:09	Arch-TK	MrElendig: I'm not talking about IT companies.
2014-06-27 23:40:10	eto	MrElendig:  it is real issue and it was reall issue now it's mainstream issue
2014-06-27 23:40:20	Arch-TK	MrElendig: Also which IT companies are these?
2014-06-27 23:40:38	MrElendig	Arch-TK: eto mentioned "sexism in IT"
2014-06-27 23:40:48	eto	MrElendig: you know feminazi are not actually helping that
2014-06-27 23:41:06	MrElendig	eto: those are not the real problem though
2014-06-27 23:41:09	MrElendig	and they are quite rare
2014-06-27 23:41:13	eto	MrElendig: what they do succesfully is pssing of everybody and widen the shitty gap even more
2014-06-27 23:41:20	Arch-TK	MrElendig: Well, quite rare, but really obnoxious.
2014-06-27 23:41:58	eto	MrElendig: stirring the hornts is not helping - only thing it helps is misandry
2014-06-27 23:42:07	MrElendig	eto: often it actually does help
2014-06-27 23:42:20	MrElendig	pretty much everything is better than silence
2014-06-27 23:42:25	eto	MrElendig: "supposedly" helps
2014-06-27 23:42:39	Arch-TK	MrElendig: Silly women who pretend to be massive victims and brag about it are not the answer.
2014-06-27 23:42:45	eto	MrElendig: all this feminist shit fucked up whole genration of women
2014-06-27 23:42:48	MrElendig	Arch-TK: men do that too
2014-06-27 23:42:54	MrElendig	eto: ...
2014-06-27 23:42:56	Arch-TK	MrElendig: Right now, that's not as obvious.
2014-06-27 23:43:03	MrElendig	eto: yes, they should all go back to the kitchen
2014-06-27 23:43:05	eto	MrElendig: men brag about being vistims of feminism??
2014-06-27 23:43:08	MrElendig	obviously
2014-06-27 23:43:09	eto	victims
2014-06-27 23:43:12	MrElendig	eto: yes
2014-06-27 23:43:29	Arch-TK	MrElendig: When it comes to these things, it matters who gets heard more, and the women who cry wolf have definitely been the more audible of people.

2014-06-27 23:44:14	MrElendig	actual real example
2014-06-27 23:44:16	Arch-TK	MrElendig: The point is, we don't need that kind of crap, where women cause a fuss over a man asking a woman out for a coffe because a man was interested in her.
2014-06-27 23:44:33	mankypirate	MrElendig: what about those pictures of brad pitt women have on their walls?

2014-06-27 23:49:28	MrElendig	you do know that the wast majority of "feminists" just want *equal* rights?
2014-06-27 23:49:40	saif_forge	bullshit

2014-06-27 23:50:05	MrElendig	mankypirate: not always by law, and certainly not in practice
2014-06-27 23:50:07	eto	MrElendig: equal rights are neurologicaly and biologically impossible
2014-06-27 23:50:09	dagle	Thats why swedish feminists wants to start concentration camps.
2014-06-27 23:50:16	eto	who comes up with such bullshit
2014-06-27 23:50:19	saif_forge	youre not equal if I cant punch you in the face
2014-06-27 23:50:23	MrElendig	mankypirate: women doing the exact same job as a man, in general earns quite a bit less
2014-06-27 23:50:26	MrElendig	as an example
2014-06-27 23:50:34	Arch-TK	MrElendig: He's talking about the few loud idiots who ruin it for everyone else.
2014-06-27 23:50:35	eto	we need to embrace heteregenous nature of the sexes
2014-06-27 23:50:44	saif_forge	MrElendig, speak for your own country
2014-06-27 23:50:49	Arch-TK	MrElendig: Also, the fact that men do this too doesn't excuse the women from doing it.
2014-06-27 23:50:59	dagle	I'm not joking. Last year they found that they had rules about starting concentration camps in their party program... Just wow.
2014-06-27 23:51:00	MrElendig	I'm not escusing anyone
2014-06-27 23:51:20	eto	MrElendig: that is corporate problem - people in 2nd & 3rd world country earn even less than those women
2014-06-27 23:51:39	MrElendig	eto: women in those countries often earn nothing/can't get any job at all
2014-06-27 23:51:44	saif_forge	feminism is a disease promulgated by corporations who want more women in the workplace
2014-06-27 23:51:47	Arch-TK	MrElendig: It doesn't matter which sex is doing this, it's nonsensical when people make a great fuss over something which has nothing to do with feminism but has all to do with their attention seeking idiot selves.
2014-06-27 23:51:53	MrElendig	eto: so not a valid argument
2014-06-27 23:52:16	eto	MrElendig: bullshit if they whore around or at least wear flashy clothes they earn much more than any male
2014-06-27 23:52:26	MrElendig	Arch-TK: those are only a tiny minority
2014-06-27 23:52:31	Arch-TK	MrElendig: Yes and?

2014-06-27 23:52:52	MrElendig	Arch-TK: eto opened with a general statement
2014-06-27 23:52:53	Arch-TK	MrElendig: He's not complaining about the actual "majority" which doesn't do such stupid shit.
2014-06-27 23:52:53	jasonwryan	saif_forge: stop trolling
2014-06-27 23:52:57	saif_forge	feminism isnt about equality
2014-06-27 23:53:01	MrElendig	Arch-TK: so I'm talking about it in general
2014-06-27 23:53:05	eto	Arch-TK: spot on

2014-06-27 23:53:05	saif_forge	im not
2014-06-27 23:53:18	saif_forge	im sick of it as well
2014-06-27 23:53:21	jasonwryan	then take your petty insecurities elsewhere
2014-06-27 23:53:39	saif_forge	what insecurities you clown?
2014-06-27 23:53:42	eto	what i don't unde4rstand is how the bar got so low any media outlet jumps on this shit to get pageviews
2014-06-27 23:53:43	saif_forge	shut the fuck up
2014-06-27 23:53:45	Arch-TK	MrElendig: Sure, it's stupid of him to make such a general statement, it's even more stupid that he's continuing to ignore how general he has been, but just try to move the argument onto what eto thinks he's arguing about.
2014-06-27 23:53:48	eto	world is totally fucked
2014-06-27 23:53:55	sr	!war feminism
2014-06-27 23:53:57	phrik	are we talking about feminism again?
2014-06-27 23:53:57	Arch-TK	MrElendig: So you can both stop having an argument about two different things.
2014-06-27 23:54:28	jasonwryan	saif_forge: you are a moron, clearly
2014-06-27 23:54:41	eto	Arch-TK: sorry my command of english is not at your level
2014-06-27 23:54:41	dagle	Also, the feminist party tried to ban standing up and peeing.
2014-06-27 23:54:52	eto	jasonwryan: misandry is on the rise and that is a fact
2014-06-27 23:54:53	jasonwryan	good luck nurturing your pathetic obsessions
2014-06-27 23:54:54	saif_forge	dagle look up shenis
2014-06-27 23:55:08	eto	jasonwryan: women can be as evil as men that is fucing fact as well
2014-06-27 23:55:12	mankypirate	eto: because most people are idiots, journalists included
2014-06-27 23:55:16	saif_forge	jasonwryan, why are you still talking?
2014-06-27 23:55:19	jasonwryan	eto: “fact” is something bandied about by the clueless and angry
2014-06-27 23:55:24	Arch-TK	See, even though dagle uses the word feminist, he doesn't mean all feminists, he's talking about a completely half minded party in sweden which calls itself a feminist party which does idiotic things.
2014-06-27 23:55:34	eto	jasonwryan: come on man
2014-06-27 23:55:39	MrElendig	dagle: a couple of the conservative swedish parties have redaction of right to vote for women in their party program too
2014-06-27 23:55:41	MrElendig	etc
2014-06-27 23:55:51	Arch-TK	That's what everyone here is complaining about. The completely idiotic minority which make a massive fuss about irrelevant things and give feminism a bad name.
2014-06-27 23:55:56	jasonwryan	listen to the poor men: there is a conspiracy of women wanting equality and we are sick of it
2014-06-27 23:55:59	jasonwryan	losers
2014-06-27 23:56:21	saif_forge	they dont want equality
2014-06-27 23:56:29	saif_forge	so again shut the fuck up
2014-06-27 23:56:32	jasonwryan	you guys live in your parents basements an imagine slights against your sex because you have no balls
2014-06-27 23:56:36	saif_forge	go back to fox news
2014-06-27 23:56:37	MrElendig	Arch-TK: sounds more like you/eto is complaining about any woman that speaks up 
2014-06-27 23:56:38	MrElendig	:p
2014-06-27 23:56:40	dagle	MrElendig: Yupp. And they are labeled nuts and get 0.000000001% of the votes.
2014-06-27 23:56:40	eto	jasonwryan: i would like more women to have computers as hobby
2014-06-27 23:56:42	jasonwryan	you are pathetic whiners and malcontents

2014-06-27 23:57:16	jasonwryan	enjoy your shity, disgruntled existence
2014-06-27 23:57:16	saif_forge	yet here you are pretending to be the exact opposite
2014-06-27 23:57:17	acidfrost	There is definitely bias-ism (w/e the actual word is) on both sides
2014-06-27 23:57:18	eto	is it gonna fix anything - nope
2014-06-27 23:57:24	Arch-TK	jasonwryan: I don't know what saif_forge said because I ignored him a good 7 months ago, but you're making as much of a silly fuss as he did before I ignored him.
2014-06-27 23:57:39	jasonwryan	Arch-TK: good idea
2014-06-27 23:57:49	eto	jasonwryan: you feminist?
2014-06-27 23:57:53	jasonwryan	yes
2014-06-27 23:57:57	eto	oh my
2014-06-27 23:57:59	Arch-TK	jasonwryan: I guss I should look at my un-ignored logs.
2014-06-27 23:58:00	saif_forge	archtk i bibes copious amounts of diarrhea
2014-06-27 23:58:01	MrElendig	eto: it will never compleatly fix the problem, but it does help
2014-06-27 23:58:02	Arch-TK	eto: Stop being silly.
2014-06-27 23:58:03	eto	got it bro
2014-06-27 23:58:05	saif_forge	d
2014-06-27 23:58:10	dagle	jasonwryan: Sry, but I don't really want to go to a concentration camp.... Is that wrong?
2014-06-27 23:58:19	eto	dagle: ++
2014-06-27 23:58:22	MrElendig	eto: eg the construction industry here in norway is a hell of a lot better now than what it was just 10 years ago
2014-06-27 23:58:30	woddf2	I am easily mistaken for one, but I prefer terms like "equalitarian" because "feminist" and "masculist" smell biased.
2014-06-27 23:58:35	saif_forge	jasonwryan, wanna be equal you gotta fuckin earn it
2014-06-27 23:58:35	jasonwryan	dagle: grow up and stop making odious, ill-informed comparisons
2014-06-27 23:58:47	woddf2	It would be like calling RMS an open-source activist.
2014-06-27 23:58:58	eto	woddf2: equality is bullshit how people can be so stupid
2014-06-27 23:59:04	Arch-TK	jasonwryan: You're being entirely ignorant of the feminist party in sweden.
2014-06-27 23:59:16	eto	woddf2: it's not possible 
2014-06-27 23:59:19	Arch-TK	jasonwryan: I doubt you would side with them if you knew what they stand for.
2014-06-27 23:59:19	saif_forge	ignorant of feminism period
2014-06-27 23:59:20	MrElendig	dagle: you better vote for the EDL then, unless you are non-arian
2014-06-27 23:59:22	MrElendig	:p
2014-06-27 23:59:28	Arch-TK	jasonwryan: In actual fact, dagle is trying to explain to you what they stand for.
2014-06-27 23:59:41	Arch-TK	jasonwryan: And you're ignoring it and telling him to grow up.
2014-06-27 23:59:44	dagle	jasonwryan: What? Where do you live? Do I need to drive to and give you papers from the swedish feminist party program? 
2014-06-28 00:00:03	MrElendig	speaking of which, the norwegian offshoot of the EDL just made the news the otehr day too
2014-06-28 00:00:15	rabbitear_sdf	USA vs. Portugal starts in 5 minutes
2014-06-28 00:00:32	saif_forge	rabbitear_sdf, USA USA USA
2014-06-28 00:00:36	dagle	MrElendig: Why? I vote for free parties.
2014-06-28 00:00:37	MrElendig	because of some anti-islam demonstration
2014-06-28 00:00:42	eto	saif_forge: yeah you are woman want to be "equal" yet shitty manager gives you lover pay and he is pushing you into harasment to keep job - then you vent onto completely powerless guys
2014-06-28 00:00:54	dagle	MrElendig: It's you, not us, that is ruled by racist parties.
2014-06-28 00:01:04	eto	saif_forge: shitty laws get passed which fuck up the shit even more - now that is great
2014-06-28 00:01:12	saif_forge	eto, im on your side bro
2014-06-28 00:01:34	saif_forge	and im fully aware of how things work
2014-06-28 00:01:34	eto	saif_forge: yeah
2014-06-28 00:01:45	eto	saif_forge: it's sad, sad i tell you
2014-06-28 00:01:45	MrElendig	dagle: rules is not exactly the right word, they have failed to do pretty much everything they went on election for :p
2014-06-28 00:02:16	MrElendig	dagle: since it is a coalition goverment, and they can't even manage to agree between themself
2014-06-28 00:02:16	MrElendig	:p
2014-06-28 00:02:28	saif_forge	eto, feminism is a way for women to rush up the corporate ladder. if they earn it like everyone else Ive got no problem. 
2014-06-28 00:02:30	eto	rabbitear_sdf: who gives fuck about fucking footbal, google went out of their way to keep people hooked
2014-06-28 00:02:45	eto	everybody is on autopilot mindcontrol - i wanna die
2014-06-28 00:02:46	MrElendig	saif_forge: actually in most cases it does the oposite
2014-06-28 00:02:55	saif_forge	but if you think youre gonna skip over me just because you have tits and a cunt I SAY NO 
2014-06-28 00:03:04	Caleb	howdy MrElendig 
2014-06-28 00:03:06	MrElendig	saif_forge: those that speak up often gets heavily discriminated against
2014-06-28 00:03:06	acidfrost	saif_forge: lol in my experience attractive women are often promoted faster(in any industry) than men with greater exp/knowledge 
2014-06-28 00:03:19	saif_forge	acidfrost, indeed
2014-06-28 00:03:27	MrElendig	same with anyone who speaks up agaist management or whatever :p
2014-06-28 00:03:33	saif_forge	and yet theyre discriminated against?
2014-06-28 00:03:49	rabbitear_sdf	eto: who gives a fuck about google! lol
2014-06-28 00:03:50	acidfrost	saif_forge: well in all fairness they make less than a man would because they take less than a man would 
2014-06-28 00:03:56	saif_forge	hahaha
2014-06-28 00:04:18	eto	MrElendig: bitches have great brains they just use them to purchase shoes, purses and lipstcks
2014-06-28 00:04:23	MrElendig	"you are raising valid complaints about the health and safetly of the work? Let me put you on this special blacklist"
2014-06-28 00:04:31	saif_forge	acidfrost, its because all they have to do is label you a mysogynist or claim sexual harassment and youre fucked
2014-06-28 00:04:32	acidfrost	ofc its not their fault usually they have no idea what the real pay is 
2014-06-28 00:04:44	eto	MrElendig: why they don't join is in fight for freedom? that is fucking beyond me
2014-06-28 00:04:45	acidfrost	and tbh most men don't either
2014-06-28 00:04:57	saif_forge	acidfrost, whatever they can suck outta this here penis.
2014-06-28 00:05:19	eto	they are starting these silly fights over bullshit while we are collectively diving into insanity - so mature
2014-06-28 00:05:30	acidfrost	so the upper mgt usually butt fucks the lower mgt and they usually butt fuck you so pretty much everyone but the top dogs gets screwed out of what their actual pay should be 
2014-06-28 00:05:44	saif_forge	acidfrost, because corporatism
2014-06-28 00:05:50	acidfrost	!MURRICA
2014-06-28 00:05:54	acidfrost	!MURICA
2014-06-28 00:05:55	phrik	FUCK YEAH!
2014-06-28 00:06:12	acidfrost	capitalism at its best
2014-06-28 00:06:22	eto	saif_forge: mose sad thing is this fucking murrican thinking get imported everywhere even to islamic countries
2014-06-28 00:06:24	saif_forge	capitaliism run fucking amok
2014-06-28 00:06:44	eto	wat the actual fuck why is this happening
2014-06-28 00:06:47	saif_forge	eto, look at saudi arabia and the driving thing
2014-06-28 00:06:50	MrElendig	eto: yes, the ISIS is busy copying american law and culture
2014-06-28 00:06:53	acidfrost	capitalism serves no real purpose other than to keep the few wealthy and the masses poor 
2014-06-28 00:07:00	saif_forge	MrElendig, isnt it?
2014-06-28 00:07:14	saif_forge	acidfrost, precisely
2014-06-28 00:07:19	eto	MrElendig: it in the food bro - in fucked up grinded shit in american made food additives
2014-06-28 00:07:23	dagle	The day you can't see that your large orginsation have idiots and some should be kicked out. Thats when your organisation is mostly ran by idiots.
2014-06-28 00:07:35	eto	MrElendig: food is only american export now - i mean "food"
2014-06-28 00:07:48	acidfrost	they try to hide it with the "income bracket" ie high class middle class lower middle class and low class 
2014-06-28 00:07:53	saif_forge	dagle, the day im not rnning the organization is when its being run by idiots
2014-06-28 00:08:23	acidfrost	eto: oh you mean mon santo's specially prepared(mon santo's sperm) foods ? 
2014-06-28 00:08:34	saif_forge	fuck man, not even the amishn are safe.
2014-06-28 00:08:44	saif_forge	*amish
2014-06-28 00:08:53	eto	acidfrost: yeah and not just that weird stabilisers and everything - america number one in that
2014-06-28 00:09:04	saif_forge	e additives lol
2014-06-28 00:09:11	acidfrost	ahh yeah people love eating GMO's don't give ten shits that eventually no natural food will be left 
2014-06-28 00:09:28	acidfrost	cept maybe some trees if they don't start modifying all of them too 
2014-06-28 00:09:36	woddf2	!ping
2014-06-28 00:09:37	phrik	pony
2014-06-28 00:09:40	eto	saif_forge: nobody is safe anymore there is even global awarenes - yet we have to solve sexism first! sexism is the cause
2014-06-28 00:09:56	saif_forge	acidfrost, most of the food we eat isnt really natural though selective breeding and crossing strains is ancient
2014-06-28 00:10:00	sr	bill gates is the cause
2014-06-28 00:10:37	saif_forge	so long as we keep letting the rich dipshits divide us were the problem
2014-06-28 00:10:40	eto	acidfrost: and they are like 5 yo kid debugging bios - they "modded" some strings and it showed them on screen - now they are like we know it dude we understand gentics
2014-06-28 00:10:57	eto	yet they have no fucking clue whatsoever
2014-06-28 00:11:03	saif_forge	they created this feminism, racism, classism, ageism
2014-06-28 00:11:17	acidfrost	sr: selective breeding i don't consider "unnatural" but actually changing the genetics of food is a horrible dumbass idea
2014-06-28 00:11:24	saif_forge	eto ever had peppermint?
2014-06-28 00:11:37	eto	saif_forge: there is so much people now and they are so brainwashed we end up in 1984 for sure
2014-06-28 00:11:44	acidfrost	s/sr/saif_forge/  
2014-06-28 00:12:25	saif_forge	acidfrost, that is changing genetics because you are crossbreeding plants
2014-06-28 00:12:30	eto	sr: well i hope he will definately have some explaning to do to peter, before he is sent straight to hell
2014-06-28 00:12:41	saif_forge	though most of the time it has been beneficial to us
2014-06-28 00:12:54	acidfrost	saif_forge: not the way I'm talking about you meant selective breeding of plants I was talking about animals
2014-06-28 00:12:55	Cirrus_Minor	Starting with systemd 215 (yet unreleased, as I type this) we will ship with a number of features in systemd that make /etc-less boots functional:
2014-06-28 00:12:56	dagle	MrElendig: I support 3rd world feminist movements and I support the idea of feminism. I have donated over $100 to female and childrens programs in other countries. But to support people representing the feminist party of sweden and people like that... it's just silly, it's beoynd silly. The largest racist party of sweden have more control of what the party does and that the ideas isn't batshit
2014-06-28 00:12:57	dagle	crazy, just wrong. So saying EDL when you haven't read the program.. should I take that as offensive?
2014-06-28 00:13:20	Cirrus_Minor	http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/stateless.html
2014-06-28 00:13:20	phrik	Title: PID EINS! (at 0pointer.de)
2014-06-28 00:13:20	saif_forge	acidfrost, thanks for the clarification
2014-06-28 00:13:20	eto	saif_forge: with selective breeding there are at least sevelar layers of cellular protection in place on top of it

2014-06-28 00:13:39	saif_forge	eto, i reject that premise
2014-06-28 00:13:45	acidfrost	cross breeding plants "can" be ok but modifying them to become more resistant to pests and be more fruitful is just wrong and its sure to come back to bite us 
2014-06-28 00:14:08	eto	acidfrost: cultivars are normal things
2014-06-28 00:14:11	saif_forge	acidfrost, thats what people said about fertilizers

2014-06-28 00:14:57	MrElendig	eto: not they are not
2014-06-28 00:15:05	saif_forge	eto,  im notma proponent of gmo foods bro
2014-06-28 00:15:11	MrElendig	fertilisers doesn't magically become ineffective

2014-07-10 13:04:43	body	you remember, when you told me you can help me with python :D ?
2014-07-10 13:04:51	body	with learning
2014-07-10 13:04:56	rabbitear_sdf	yeah
2014-07-10 13:05:09	rabbitear_sdf	everybody can help you, but I'll help you too body 
2014-07-10 13:05:34	body	ty :D , i can't understand what __init__ and super() do :\
2014-07-10 13:05:55	rabbitear_sdf	__init__ == main ?
2014-07-10 13:06:18	Arch-TK	Python?
2014-07-10 13:06:27	Arch-TK	__init__ is just a variable
2014-07-10 13:06:28	body	like when you declare a class
2014-07-10 13:06:32	rabbitear_sdf	you don't need it, but you need to know some namespace
2014-07-10 13:06:33	Arch-TK	Wait.
2014-07-10 13:06:35	Arch-TK	Hmm.
2014-07-10 13:06:37	Arch-TK	No.
2014-07-10 13:06:43	Arch-TK	__name__ is a variable.
2014-07-10 13:06:53	rabbitear_sdf	super() also is inside namespaces
2014-07-10 13:07:01	Arch-TK	super is for inheritance3.
2014-07-10 13:07:09	Arch-TK	super is the superclass
2014-07-10 13:07:19	rabbitear_sdf	they call it object fucking shit, but its weirder
2014-07-10 13:07:27	Arch-TK	calling super should be like calling the __init__ of the superclass
2014-07-10 13:07:33	rabbitear_sdf	actually I'm weider
2014-07-10 13:07:36	body	hmmm
2014-07-10 13:08:04	john_f	__init__() is the function run when you create an instance of that class
2014-07-10 13:08:20	rabbitear_sdf	body: you give up the girls
2014-07-10 13:08:25	Arch-TK	In "jarva"
2014-07-10 13:08:35	Arch-TK	__init__ would just be the class name,.
2014-07-10 13:08:41	Arch-TK	class Bla:
2014-07-10 13:08:42	john_f	SuperClass(foo) needs def __init__(self, foo):
2014-07-10 13:08:45	Arch-TK	def Bla:
2014-07-10 13:08:48	Arch-TK	so when you make a new Bla
2014-07-10 13:08:56	Arch-TK	with Bla bla = new Bla()
2014-07-10 13:09:01	Arch-TK	you're calling the Bla inside Bla
2014-07-10 13:09:10	body	oh, so  let me understand
2014-07-10 13:09:12	Arch-TK	Except in python the Bla inside Bla is called __init__
2014-07-10 13:09:19	Arch-TK	but is called by the name of the class.
2014-07-10 13:09:21	rabbitear_sdf	thats not out to call a class in Python
2014-07-10 13:09:25	body	if i declare a class , in that class i should have defs
2014-07-10 13:09:35	john_f	yes
2014-07-10 13:09:36	rabbitear_sdf	is there, new in Python?
2014-07-10 13:09:44	body	ok
2014-07-10 13:09:44	rabbitear_sdf	I forgot... actually
2014-07-10 13:09:50	rabbitear_sdf	there is in Perl
2014-07-10 13:10:02	rabbitear_sdf	another shitty language
2014-07-10 13:10:03	body	if i have
2014-07-10 13:10:04	body	def __init__(self):
2014-07-10 13:10:05	body	        print "Base created"
2014-07-10 13:10:29	Arch-TK	body: A class is like a struct with functions that act on the members of the struct.
2014-07-10 13:10:57	Arch-TK	body: No, you shouldn't just print "Base created"
2014-07-10 13:11:00	rabbitear_sdf	Arch-TK: you talk like you know c
2014-07-10 13:11:07	john_f	only helps if you know c.
2014-07-10 13:11:15	Arch-TK	the __init__ function in a class is designed for initialising class members like variables that should have values.
2014-07-10 13:11:37	body	Arch-TK: fuch me , i don't get it
2014-07-10 13:11:39	Arch-TK	You might if you have class A
2014-07-10 13:11:41	Arch-TK	which has a variable b
2014-07-10 13:11:47	Arch-TK	a function increment
2014-07-10 13:11:50	Arch-TK	and a function decrement
2014-07-10 13:11:57	Arch-TK	the __init__ function should set the initial value of b
2014-07-10 13:12:05	Arch-TK	so increment()
2014-07-10 13:12:10	Arch-TK	increments b from the initial value
2014-07-10 13:12:16	Arch-TK	and decrement() decrements
2014-07-10 13:12:21	rabbitear_sdf	you can --fucktion()
2014-07-10 13:12:24	rabbitear_sdf	just kidding

2014-07-10 13:12:30	pythonsnake	is redmine good?
2014-07-10 13:12:42	Arch-TK	project management software?
2014-07-10 13:12:43	rabbitear_sdf	actually the fuction is a pointer
2014-07-10 13:12:45	Arch-TK	Like git?
2014-07-10 13:12:46	rabbitear_sdf	but!
2014-07-10 13:13:00	pythonsnake	no

2014-07-10 13:18:29	body	with a def
2014-07-10 13:18:41	rabbitear_sdf	forget about classes

2014-07-10 13:18:54	Arch-TK	body: http://sprunge.us/KNGP
2014-07-10 13:18:56	rabbitear_sdf	body: do shit that works
2014-07-10 13:19:23	rabbitear_sdf	body: you call it starting from a, and going to the b is or some shit
2014-07-10 13:19:48	Arch-TK	body: That's how simple it is.
2014-07-10 13:19:50	wasamasa	closures are all you need
2014-07-10 13:19:50	rabbitear_sdf	body: you should just read code
2014-07-10 13:19:53	Arch-TK	A class has methods and fields.
2014-07-10 13:20:11	Arch-TK	The methods act on the variables that are part of that class.
2014-07-10 13:20:16	Arch-TK	the methods are meant to modify the class.
2014-07-10 13:20:21	Arch-TK	Imagine it like a cup.
2014-07-10 13:20:24	rabbitear_sdf	usually got an A in java
2014-07-10 13:20:27	Arch-TK	You can fill() a cup
2014-07-10 13:20:36	wasamasa	you can start() a car
2014-07-10 13:20:37	Arch-TK	with a liquid = "coffee" for example.
2014-07-10 13:20:47	Arch-TK	and an amount = "100ml"
2014-07-10 13:20:53	john_f	but you wouldn't download() a car would you?
2014-07-10 13:20:58	wasamasa	nope
2014-07-10 13:21:00	Arch-TK	(It would be an int instead normally but let's stick to strings for now.)
2014-07-10 13:21:02	body	john_f: :))
2014-07-10 13:21:16	body	ok let me look at your code Arch-TK 
2014-07-10 13:21:31	Arch-TK	body: The class I showed you is a simple class which takes an initial value and through the use of the inc() and dec() functions you increase and decrease the value.
2014-07-10 13:21:31	wasamasa	also, I feel like oop is pretty mediocre at modeling real-life examples
2014-07-10 13:21:41	Arch-TK	To read it you can access the value directly from the class instance.
2014-07-10 13:21:47	Arch-TK	Or create a function which returns the value.
2014-07-10 13:22:27	wasamasa	and too complicated for simplified models
2014-07-10 13:24:03	body	Arch-TK: can we take line by line ? and i tell you what i understand and what no ? 
2014-07-10 13:24:12	Arch-TK	Yes sure.
2014-07-10 13:24:25	body	oke, so class Counter: #gives the class name
2014-07-10 13:24:38	body	def __init__(self, init_value):
2014-07-10 13:24:52	john_f	damn it is quiet, no fans because of the cool air the hurricane brought down, no traffic cause of the holiday...
2014-07-10 13:25:02	Arch-TK	I should mention, all functions take the self variable.
2014-07-10 13:25:11	Arch-TK	which is the current instance being acted on.

2014-07-10 13:25:31	body	aaaa
2014-07-10 13:25:33	Arch-TK	Basically, I'm pretty sure you can not only use c.inc() but also Counter.inc(c)
2014-07-10 13:25:41	rabbitear_sdf	brb.....
2014-07-10 13:26:29	body	so every def , have to have a __init__(self, variable) ?
2014-07-10 13:26:52	body	self, variable,string,etc
2014-07-10 13:27:08	pythonsnake	trac or redmine

2014-07-10 13:27:25	Arch-TK	Yeah.
2014-07-10 13:27:25	rabbitear_sdf	maybe.
2014-07-10 13:27:31	Arch-TK	I wrote a slightly different version now.
2014-07-10 13:27:36	rabbitear_sdf	but stick to beer fir right now
2014-07-10 13:28:26	body	Arch-TK: you wrote a different verions of that code ?

2014-07-10 13:39:26	wasamasa	nope :P
2014-07-10 13:39:32	body	Arch-TK: i think i get it
2014-07-10 13:39:34	body	hmm
2014-07-10 13:39:52	Arch-TK	wasamasa: Thanks, you're for once useful.
2014-07-10 13:39:55	body	only the __init__ one i don't get it , let me explain it
2014-07-10 13:40:11	wasamasa	body: there are special methods you can use to implement behaviour in python
2014-07-10 13:40:29	wasamasa	body: like if you implement __add__, you can use addition with objects derived from that class
2014-07-10 13:40:49	Arch-TK	body: It's also called operator overloading.
2014-07-10 13:41:01	Arch-TK	where normally if a and b were an instance of class C
2014-07-10 13:41:01	wasamasa	well, not really
2014-07-10 13:41:02	body	wait, let me check if i get the other things, 
2014-07-10 13:41:04	Arch-TK	and you did a + b
2014-07-10 13:41:09	Arch-TK	python would give you an error.
2014-07-10 13:41:19	Arch-TK	But if you define an __add__ function for class C
2014-07-10 13:41:35	Arch-TK	a + b will work and give you the behaviour defined in __add__
2014-07-10 13:41:44	rabbitear_sdf	atleast any classes you take body don't pay for them
2014-07-10 13:42:19	rabbitear_sdf	Arch-TK: I know your not *hickup* helping him, by saying c
2014-07-10 13:42:35	rabbitear_sdf	Arch-TK: bad teacher
2014-07-10 13:42:37	Arch-TK	C is a class name not the language.
2014-07-10 13:42:44	Arch-TK	stop complaining.,
2014-07-10 13:42:52	rabbitear_sdf	oh, okay
2014-07-10 13:42:57	wasamasa	https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=__add__#special-method-names
2014-07-10 13:42:58	phrik	Title: 3. Data model Python 3.4.1 documentation (at docs.python.org)
2014-07-10 13:43:25	wasamasa	implementing __str__ for example clearly doesn't affect operators :P
2014-07-10 13:43:42	wasamasa	no, it tells python how to derive the string representation of the object
2014-07-10 13:43:48	wasamasa	so it's more like @Override in java
2014-07-10 13:44:11	rabbitear_sdf	I hate that
2014-07-10 13:44:19	body	Arch-TK: so , def __init__(self, init_value):  so def is the method, init = don't get it yet, self # is the name i will use after , like , yolo=Counter(0)
2014-07-10 13:44:33	Arch-TK	wasamasa: I know, but __add__ is operator overloading by definition.
2014-07-10 13:44:52	Arch-TK	Look at the second example.
2014-07-10 13:44:58	Arch-TK	I say that d = Counter
2014-07-10 13:45:09	Arch-TK	which now means that d is an instance of Counter.
2014-07-10 13:45:17	Arch-TK	which is half of what c = Counter(0) does
2014-07-10 13:45:27	Arch-TK	then I do. Counter.__init__(d, 1)
2014-07-10 13:45:31	Arch-TK	which is the other half.
2014-07-10 13:45:37	Arch-TK	c = Counter(0) does both.
2014-07-10 13:45:51	Arch-TK	It says that c is an instance of counter, and then calls Counter.__init__(c, 0)
2014-07-10 13:45:57	Arch-TK	which sets the value of c.count = 0
2014-07-10 13:46:06	body	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
2014-07-10 13:46:20	Arch-TK	c = Counter(0) is syntactic sugar for d = Counter; Counter.__init__(d, 1)
2014-07-10 13:46:33	Arch-TK	or more accurately
2014-07-10 13:46:39	Arch-TK	c = Counter(0) is syntactic sugar for c = Counter; Counter.__init__(c, 0)
2014-07-10 13:47:00	Arch-TK	In the same way that c.inc() is syntactic sugar for Counter.inc(c)
2014-07-10 13:47:16	Arch-TK	syntactic sugar just means it looks better but does the same thing.
2014-07-10 13:47:49	body	so , c = Counter(0)  or using c = Counter than , Counter.__init__(d, 1) are the same ?
2014-07-10 13:47:56	body	aa
2014-07-10 13:48:18	body	so i can memorize the first one , it's more simple
2014-07-10 13:48:23	body	c = Counter(0)
2014-07-10 13:48:47	Arch-TK	yes
2014-07-10 13:49:03	wasamasa	in python you generally avoid accessing methods starting with underscores
2014-07-10 13:49:13	Arch-TK	They're usually special.
2014-07-10 13:49:13	body	rabbitear_sdf: if i will leran with you here, be sure i will not pay :D
2014-07-10 13:49:18	Arch-TK	For special purposes.
2014-07-10 13:49:22	wasamasa	as they're considered implementation details
2014-07-10 13:49:37	Arch-TK	Then there's underscore variables.

2014-07-11 03:15:56	Roukoswarf	i still think systemd is the best thing since btrfs got started
2014-07-11 03:16:10	Roukoswarf	see last comment, and lul
2014-07-11 03:16:11	Roukoswarf	systemd is the end of GNU/Linux. Lennart is a talentless, loudmouthed, egoistic hack. Redhat is a toxic company. I switched to *BSD a year ago and so did my company. Everything is so much better now.
2014-07-11 03:16:20	Roukoswarf	THE END IS NIGH
2014-07-11 03:16:24	Roukoswarf	FLY YOU FOOLS
2014-07-11 03:16:30	DarkFox	Eh
2014-07-11 03:16:57	DarkFox	SystemD has some good features; but it could have been done far simplier and cleaner.
2014-07-11 03:17:06	DarkFox	ZFS > BtrFS
2014-07-11 03:17:08	DarkFox	:)
2014-07-11 03:17:14	Roukoswarf	zfs is old and mouldy
2014-07-11 03:17:23	Roukoswarf	and is annoying on linux
2014-07-11 03:17:24	Roukoswarf	and slow
2014-07-11 03:17:29	DarkFox	Roukoswarf: No...
2014-07-11 03:17:35	DarkFox	Roukoswarf: It's still in heavy development
2014-07-11 03:17:36	DarkFox	lol
2014-07-11 03:17:47	DarkFox	It's mature, but not dying by any means
2014-07-11 03:17:59	Roukoswarf	didnt they just recently get non fuse drivers working for it?
2014-07-11 03:18:00	DarkFox	Btrfs sucks in comparasion
2014-07-11 03:18:11	DarkFox	Roukoswarf: Wut
2014-07-11 03:18:24	Roukoswarf	the kernel drivers needed to be recoded for licencing issues, no?
2014-07-11 03:18:28	DarkFox	Roukoswarf: Not even recently...
2014-07-11 03:18:34	DarkFox	Indeed
2014-07-11 03:18:39	DarkFox	While back now
2014-07-11 03:18:43	Roukoswarf	recently aka <1.5 years

2014-07-11 03:18:59	DarkFox	Maybe longer than that...
2014-07-11 03:19:06	Roukoswarf	i just want something nice and built into the kernel
2014-07-11 03:19:14	Roukoswarf	btrfs is missing a couple things, yes
2014-07-11 03:19:18	Roukoswarf	its debug sucks, yes
2014-07-11 03:19:20	DarkFox	...
2014-07-11 03:19:22	DarkFox	Like stability
2014-07-11 03:19:37	Roukoswarf	stability is fine till you use btrfs raid5
2014-07-11 03:19:45	Roukoswarf	raid5 is still a mess
2014-07-11 03:19:49	Roukoswarf	works, but mess
2014-07-11 03:19:50	DarkFox	I've been on btrfs for a while now; this laptop was freshly installed on Jan 1 2013.
2014-07-11 03:20:10	DarkFox	It sure could be more stable
2014-07-11 03:20:17	DarkFox	Only panics that I get are from btrfs
2014-07-11 03:20:24	woddf2	DarkFox: I still have a vestigial ext3 partition from when this box ran GNU/Linux.
2014-07-11 03:20:27	DarkFox	hangs too, if not btrfs; then xorg. One of the two. :P
2014-07-11 03:20:33	Roukoswarf	i havnt had any panics
2014-07-11 03:20:46	DarkFox	Roukoswarf: I haven't had any btrfs panic for a few months now
2014-07-11 03:20:47	Roukoswarf	but, im not currently raiding any btrfs
2014-07-11 03:20:58	DarkFox	I'm on a 32G SSD

2014-07-11 03:21:08	Roukoswarf	btrfs became REALLY stable on like, 3.13

2014-07-11 03:21:57	DarkFox	It's also encrypted. :P
2014-07-11 03:22:00	Roukoswarf	btrfs was less stable the more full it was

2014-07-11 03:48:22	fengshaun	how do I change termite's name? It's xterm-termite and ssh refuses connection until I start tmux with screen-256color
2014-07-11 03:48:35	fengshaun	I mean, htop over ssh refuses to run
2014-07-11 03:49:22	acidfrost	fengshaun: set $TERM i think 
2014-07-11 03:49:51	fengshaun	tahnks
2014-07-11 03:50:00	fengshaun	because thanks* is too mainstream
2014-07-11 03:50:03	acidfrost	hmm mines set to screen-256color 
2014-07-11 03:50:13	fengshaun	$TERM?
2014-07-11 03:50:14	acidfrost	haven't changed any settings
2014-07-11 03:50:18	acidfrost	fengshaun: yes
2014-07-11 03:50:29	fengshaun	ah, yeah, it's xterm-termite for me
2014-07-11 03:50:30	acidfrost	I don't have an ssh box to test out your issue though 
2014-07-11 03:50:32	acidfrost	oh ?
2014-07-11 03:50:41	fengshaun	yea
2014-07-11 03:50:44	acidfrost	fengshaun: are you using an aur package or git ?
2014-07-11 03:50:55	fengshaun	hmmm don't remember
2014-07-11 03:50:56	acidfrost	I think I'm using the git version 
2014-07-11 03:51:02	fengshaun	no, not git for me
2014-07-11 03:51:15	fengshaun	maybe I should use the git version
2014-07-11 03:51:34	acidfrost	regardless screen-256color is what mine is and should be the default imho since it plays nice with tmux ;p 
2014-07-11 03:52:12	fengshaun	I have tmux set to screen-256color, I'll just switch termite too
2014-07-11 03:52:43	acidfrost	fengshaun: ohh wait a second, $TERM with no tmux session is just xterm-termite
2014-07-11 03:53:02	acidfrost	inside tmux though its screen-256color 
2014-07-11 03:53:52	fengshaun	ah, there you go
2014-07-11 03:53:53	acidfrost	fengshaun: add set -g default-terminal "screen-256color" to your .tmux.conf
2014-07-11 03:54:10	fengshaun	yea, I have tmux set up, but without tmux htop over ssh goes chop chop

2014-07-11 03:56:32	fengshaun	still xterm-termite
2014-07-11 03:56:38	fengshaun	I guess that carries over
2014-07-11 03:57:10	acidfrost	yeah I wasn't thinking sorry it would ofc carry over since you basically just asked the shell what $TERM your using
2014-07-11 03:57:34	fengshaun	:D
2014-07-11 03:57:36	acidfrost	fengshaun: try another term and see if the issue persists like urxvt
2014-07-11 03:57:51	acidfrost	or even a raw TTY 
2014-07-11 03:58:31	fengshaun	nope, it's working

2014-07-11 05:12:20	halosghost	why
2014-07-11 05:12:24	halosghost	sorry, misread the question
2014-07-11 05:12:30	fengshaun	:D
2014-07-11 05:12:40	halosghost	because, when I started writing shaman, Rust's libcurl support was pretty sketch
2014-07-11 05:12:45	halosghost	not sure if that's changed
2014-07-11 05:12:54	fengshaun	ah
2014-07-11 05:13:04	halosghost	also, I wanted to provide a very basic library that could be wrapped for other languages
2014-07-11 05:13:28	halosghost	so, I'm considering (once Rust's libcurl support is more stable) writing a wrapper for libweather (or whatever the backend will be) in Rust
2014-07-11 05:13:42	halosghost	so that way Rust programs could safely interact with libweather
2014-07-11 05:13:52	halosghost	would be a good Rust project
2014-07-11 05:14:28	fengshaun	yea
2014-07-11 05:15:26	halosghost	let me go take a look at Rust's libcurl support

2014-07-11 05:22:04	phrik	Title: carllerche/curl-rust · GitHub (at github.com)
2014-07-11 05:23:31	halosghost	yeah, that project looks fairly stable
2014-07-11 05:23:37	halosghost	or, at least, tolerably so
2014-07-11 05:24:32	diegoviola	what's the hype with rust?
2014-07-11 05:24:44	diegoviola	what's so great about it
2014-07-11 05:24:56	halosghost	diegoviola: it's C++ with less shitty syntax
2014-07-11 05:25:10	halosghost	it's also safe and concurrent by-design which is nice
2014-07-11 05:25:22	diegoviola	hrm
2014-07-11 05:25:44	halosghost	It also draws a bunch of inspiration from Haskell
2014-07-11 05:25:53	diegoviola	hrm
2014-07-11 05:25:55	halosghost	which leads to some awesome functionality
2014-07-11 05:26:03	halosghost	and, I love its implementation of OOP
2014-07-11 05:26:07	diegoviola	hrm
2014-07-11 05:27:06	fengshaun	diegoviola: Rust is what you would get if C and Haskell had passionate sex and made a baby who inherited the best of the traits!
2014-07-11 05:27:42	halosghost	With a really nice implementation of OOP that makes Java look just as silly as it is
2014-07-11 05:27:44	fengshaun	I find it hard to remain excited, though. So many languages and come and died
2014-07-11 05:27:57	diegoviola	don't we already have erlang for that?
2014-07-11 05:28:04	diegoviola	oh wait, erlang syntax is not as nice i guess?
2014-07-11 05:28:12	fengshaun	halosghost: the "OOP" in Rust is more functional than C++/java/etc.
2014-07-11 05:28:31	halosghost	fengshaun: functional in a general sense, it's not really functional style
2014-07-11 05:28:33	halosghost	but yeah
2014-07-11 05:28:36	fengshaun	diegoviola: doesn't erlang have purity and stuff?
2014-07-11 05:28:50	diegoviola	not sure
2014-07-11 05:30:00	fengshaun	I guess it doesn't, actually
2014-07-11 05:33:05	diegoviola	what's purity? sorry i haven't checked enough about rust yet
2014-07-11 05:33:20	halosghost	purity is a Functional thing
2014-07-11 05:33:37	halosghost	it's about code not changing state or the world
2014-07-11 05:34:03	fengshaun	rust used to have `pure' keyword
2014-07-11 05:34:04	halosghost	Rust doesn't care so much about that
2014-07-11 05:34:06	fengshaun	they removed it
2014-07-11 05:35:32	diegoviola	i see
2014-07-11 05:35:35	diegoviola	i'll look into it
2014-07-11 05:35:41	diegoviola	i haven't been into functional languages yet
2014-07-11 05:36:37	halosghost	they're… different
2014-07-11 05:36:42	halosghost	good though
2014-07-11 05:37:01	fengshaun	from what I've read, rust seems to make a good balance of functional and imperative
2014-07-11 05:37:10	halosghost	well
2014-07-11 05:37:16	halosghost	it's really pretty heavy on the imperative
2014-07-11 05:37:17	fengshaun	although I would've liked to see more functional in it
2014-07-11 05:37:22	fengshaun	yea
2014-07-11 05:37:26	halosghost	but it does bring a lot of great things from Haskell
2014-07-11 05:37:35	fengshaun	yea, especially typeclasses
2014-07-11 05:37:38	halosghost	e.g., pattern matching
2014-07-11 05:37:43	halosghost	oh man, pattern matching
2014-07-11 05:37:46	fengshaun	and algebraic types

2014-07-11 05:39:31	fengshaun	is rust optimized for tail recursion? I hope so
2014-07-11 05:40:15	fengshaun	with the type variables and pattern match and the data types + typeclasses, it looks like you *can* go pretty heavy functional
2014-07-11 05:40:17	halosghost	somehow, I doubt it
2014-07-11 05:40:23	fengshaun	oh man, I just hope it stays around

2014-07-11 05:42:20	halosghost	pretty sure Rust won't do tail calls
2014-07-11 05:46:19	halosghost	I mean, If you're gonnd do tail recursion, you might as well do it in Haskell
2014-07-11 05:46:47	halosghost	Rust is more interested in making an updated version of C that is more elegant
2014-07-11 05:50:40	iv597	Please tell me I'm not the only one that finds Rust semi-redundant. It's fighting for the same target audience as Go, with very few unique features to make it worthwhile, and came a couple years late to the party.
2014-07-11 05:51:07	iv597	I appreciate the effort they're doing with Rust, but it's really similar to Ubuntu Touch trying to hop in Android's ring, in my opinion.
2014-07-11 05:52:01	fengshaun	iv597: what's wrong with hopping in others' rings?
2014-07-11 05:53:17	halosghost	iv597: let me go check up on Go again, but I was under the impression that Rust was doing a few things a fair bit differently
2014-07-11 05:54:20	halosghost	ugh, I forgot how much I disliked Go's reference compiler
2014-07-11 05:54:24	iv597	fengshaun: I'm split on that. On one hand, comeptition is great. On the other, there's my common problem with F/OSS... if you're going to do the same thing (or largely same), go try to contribute your manpower to the project that ALREADY DOES IT. I have the same bitching with Wayland/Mir, the 9001 OpenSSL forks (LibreSSL is *the* answer to OpenSSL, can we please just accept this?), etc.

2014-07-11 06:00:33	halosghost	iv597: Go doesn't have tuples
2014-07-11 06:00:45	halosghost	tuples are awesome :P
2014-07-11 06:00:56	fengshaun	talking about reinventing the wheel, lennart spoke about the future of systemd
2014-07-11 06:01:05	fengshaun	looks like it's going to do everything
2014-07-11 06:01:19	halosghost	lennartctl is awesome
2014-07-11 06:01:22	fengshaun	I hope they include systemd-kitchensinkd
2014-07-11 06:01:25	halosghost	don't make fun of lennartd
2014-07-11 06:02:10	fengshaun	I just don't understand all the enthusiasm about 'one program to rule them all' that's going around
2014-07-11 06:02:29	fengshaun	I like being able to swap tools in and out without worrying about compatibility and shit
2014-07-11 06:03:09	halosghost	for me, the benefit is having a consistent and predictable system
2014-07-11 06:03:22	halosghost	not to mention that it's one that works quite well
2014-07-11 06:03:29	fengshaun	oh, he also said he wants linux to become "competitive" with other OSes
2014-07-11 06:04:03	iv597	halosghost: Man, I don't even use tuples in Python which was written around the fucking things. Nor do I use sets. Arrays are the One True Form of non-keyed datasets, end of discussion.
2014-07-11 06:04:06	fengshaun	well, journalctl has been failing on me a few times already

2014-07-11 06:05:23	iv597	systemd is hit and miss for me. journald is shit, service autorespawning is useful until it does it when you don't want it, the instant boot times is awesome, and back and forth it goes. I've considered busybox+minirc, but honestly systemd Just Works™
2014-07-11 06:05:28	halosghost	fengshaun: you can use syslog
2014-07-11 06:05:44	fengshaun	halosghost: don't you have to route it through journalctl anyway?
2014-07-11 06:05:55	halosghost	well, you make it work with journalctl
2014-07-11 06:06:09	fengshaun	ah, not what I wanted
2014-07-11 06:06:24	fengshaun	that's the problem, you can't just stop using journalctl
2014-07-11 06:06:26	iv597	And by the way, unit files are THE answer to init systems. Like, I've considered forking minirc just to add support for them. To hell with socket-spawning and such, just give me the standardized cross-distribution method of defining an init file. INI files, bam. How simple.
2014-07-11 06:06:37	fengshaun	you have to make other shit play nice with it
2014-07-11 06:06:46	diegoviola	systemdoomsday
2014-07-11 06:06:48	diegoviola	i bet in the not so distant future we'll see a new cool and small init system again and ripping systemd off the system will be a pain in the ass
2014-07-11 06:07:23	fengshaun	I would like a tiny init system with the rest of the jobs left their respective utilities
2014-07-11 06:07:24	iv597	Had a freelance gig where I had to write a daemon in Python. Went great until I had to manage writing a RHEL/CentOS init script. Ended up stealing one off GitHub because fuck that massive amount of boilerplate.
2014-07-11 06:08:58	fengshaun	like freebsd already has to reimplement systemd interfaces because applications won't work without the dbus interfaces
2014-07-11 06:09:22	fengshaun	how far is too far?
2014-07-11 06:09:32	iv597	fengshaun: So you're arguing against dbus, too, now?
2014-07-11 06:09:39	diegoviola	fengshaun: what applications?
2014-07-11 06:09:52	fengshaun	hold on, let me find the report

2014-07-11 06:10:54	diegoviola	are you against coreutils too?
2014-07-11 06:10:54	iv597	fair
2014-07-11 06:11:18	fengshaun	diegoviola: you can swap its components in and out
2014-07-11 06:11:25	iv597	diegoviola: at least he's not locked into coreutils. He can go grab the BSD stack and, spare some fringe flags, it'll do the same
2014-07-11 06:11:39	iv597	Or busybox
2014-07-11 06:11:41	diegoviola	fengshaun: i can recompile systemd and just keep the journal
2014-07-11 06:11:42	fengshaun	diegoviola: that's a ton of *separate* utilities
2014-07-11 06:11:44	iv597	or several other implementations
2014-07-11 06:11:51	diegoviola	fengshaun: systemd is also separate utilities
2014-07-11 06:12:15	fengshaun	I guess I can compile it with just the init part
2014-07-11 06:12:18	fengshaun	whatever that part is

2014-07-11 06:17:27	fengshaun	but from what I've heard, you have to be with systemd or against it!
2014-07-11 06:17:49	fengshaun	journald being an example of my issue with systemd
2014-07-11 06:18:03	fengshaun	"if you want to use systemd, you *also* have to use journald"
2014-07-11 06:21:23	iv597	I'm totally with you on journald being a piece of shit, but I believe you can forward to syslog still. Which really solves that problem for the most part.
2014-07-11 06:22:02	fengshaun	well, it's still working around it

2014-07-11 08:07:05	Roukoswarf	or does it not even have odin
2014-07-11 08:07:05	halosghost	no
2014-07-11 08:07:05	halosghost	Odin/Heimdall are Sammy-specific

2014-07-11 08:07:05	halosghost	It might have something similar

2014-07-11 08:08:35	halosghost	Roukoswarf: Heimdall is much, much better
2014-07-11 08:08:35	Roukoswarf	halosghost: the system itself is the flawed one
2014-07-11 08:08:35	Roukoswarf	not the client
2014-07-11 08:08:35	halosghost	yeah, but Odin is based on a leak
2014-07-11 08:08:35	halosghost	it's not pretty
2014-07-11 08:08:35	DarkFox	Why did they even lock the boot loader? :C
2014-07-11 08:08:35	halosghost	in fact, it's quite hacky
2014-07-11 08:08:35	halosghost	DarkFox: because you're a haxxor that's gonna break their network
2014-07-11 08:08:35	halosghost	they have to stop you however they can
2014-07-11 08:09:34	buhman	James_T: didn't you say you booted a jessie kernel on a linode?
2014-07-11 08:09:34	James_T	no?

2014-07-11 08:09:34	DarkFox	halosghost: Suggestions ? :P
2014-07-11 08:09:34	Roukoswarf	DarkFox: because they want an excuse to say that you tampered the phone
2014-07-11 08:09:34	James_T	i'm booting grub2 on a linode
2014-07-11 08:09:34	James_T	:p
2014-07-11 08:10:32	Roukoswarf	so they can stop supporting it if it breaks for ANY reason

2014-07-11 08:10:32	DarkFox	Sure
2014-07-11 08:10:32	halosghost	it, unfortunately, is
2014-07-11 08:10:32	DarkFox	But... need to get around it
2014-07-11 08:10:38	Roukoswarf	just like "dont remove this tag unless you are the final recipient, and are satisfied with the item"
2014-07-11 08:10:46	Roukoswarf	and you remove the tag
2014-07-11 08:10:50	Roukoswarf	by accident or otherwise
2014-07-11 08:10:58	Roukoswarf	and now, you cant return it cause its b0rked
2014-07-11 08:11:36	Roukoswarf	even some clothes stores will do that

2014-07-11 08:18:06	halosghost	DarkFox: unlikely
2014-07-11 08:18:06	Roukoswarf	DarkFox: yeah, as much as god is preventing you
2014-07-11 08:18:06	halosghost	but possible
2014-07-11 08:18:06	DarkFox	halosghost: Indeed
2014-07-11 08:18:07	halosghost	pretty unlikely though
2014-07-11 08:18:11	halosghost	since, afaik, no one has done that
2014-07-11 08:18:11	Roukoswarf	not even cdma can do that
2014-07-11 08:18:20	Roukoswarf	not physically possible with gsm for sure
2014-07-11 08:19:25	DarkFox	Without sim, I have a different menu...
2014-07-11 08:20:09	Roukoswarf	fastboot may show sim data
2014-07-11 08:20:09	Roukoswarf	but theres no mechanism for locking up phones from the sim
2014-07-11 08:20:36	Roukoswarf	cdma phones (like verizon) may be recoded to work differently, and not unlockable
2014-07-11 08:21:34	DarkFox	"Reset customization and reboot?
2014-07-11 08:21:41	DarkFox	Clear and factory reset
2014-07-11 08:21:43	DarkFox	Not quite :P
2014-07-11 08:22:22	DarkFox	Doesn't appear to be another menu, I must have gone into the top menu by mistake the first time.

2014-07-11 08:28:05	face_drop	DarkFox, well it is kinda bad because you aren't easily accessible
2014-07-11 08:28:11	fengshaun	someone asked to "trade numbers" and I said I don't have a number...haven't heard from them ever since
2014-07-11 08:28:22	Roukoswarf	i use a pure data plan
2014-07-11 08:28:27	Roukoswarf	and use sip
2014-07-11 08:28:29	fengshaun	I thought it may be a pop culture thing that not having a phone is a sin against humanity
2014-07-11 08:28:41	face_drop	I have unlimited data/sms and 100min
2014-07-11 08:28:42	Roukoswarf	i need a cell phone and data

2014-07-11 08:29:38	fengshaun	so, what about as far as "normal people" go?
2014-07-11 08:29:44	fengshaun	do they see it as a sin?
2014-07-11 08:29:48	Roukoswarf	yes

2014-07-11 08:29:54	DarkFox	halosghost: "Reports have come in from a variety of sources including XDA, Reddit, and blogs that make it clear this device is more locked down than the original Z1. With that device, all one needs to do is head to Sony's develop portal and get an unlock code that can be applied via fastboot. The Z1s, however, doesn't allow unlocking through any official means at this time."
2014-07-11 08:29:57	face_drop	decent amount of data, some minutes, and unlimited text
2014-07-11 08:30:00	DarkFox	:C
2014-07-11 08:30:02	face_drop	thats pretty standard
2014-07-11 08:30:18	Roukoswarf	i dont get texting
2014-07-11 08:30:29	Roukoswarf	i use gvoice for texting if i need it for some reason
2014-07-11 08:30:39	Roukoswarf	most canadians have unlimited international texting
2014-07-11 08:30:39	face_drop	its convenient to have an almost instant IM client on your phone tied to your identifying number
2014-07-11 08:30:48	Roukoswarf	eh, i use hangouts
2014-07-11 08:31:04	Roukoswarf	i send easily 15000 hangouts messages a month
2014-07-11 08:31:09	DarkFox	That was for the Z1, but I guess the MTxxi is newer and just as locked down :C
2014-07-11 08:31:23	face_drop	it depends on who you contact and how they contact you
2014-07-11 08:31:26	DarkFox	Or maybe not...
2014-07-11 08:31:34	DarkFox	halosghost: Sola is quite an older device...
2014-07-11 08:31:58	halosghost	oh

2014-07-11 08:32:02	halosghost	I didn't know
2014-07-11 08:32:10	halosghost	if so, then it'll be terrible to do anything with
2014-07-11 08:32:14	face_drop	its just different means of commincation because of capitalism
2014-07-11 08:32:45	face_drop	this stuff is cheap enough now that you can get a standard plan to handle all cellular needs for a decent price
2014-07-11 08:33:03	face_drop	a finite number of texts and minutes and some decent data size
2014-07-11 08:33:08	face_drop	there is no reason to not ahve one
2014-07-11 08:33:16	face_drop	unless you are a cheap person
2014-07-11 08:33:23	face_drop	and a shutin
2014-07-11 08:33:24	Roukoswarf	prices are insane here in canada
2014-07-11 08:33:37	Roukoswarf	we have giant pipes, and charge insane rates for little amounts
2014-07-11 08:33:37	face_drop	(I realize I'm saying that to people on IRC... oh the irony)
2014-07-11 08:33:46	face_drop	In the states it isn't that bad.

2014-07-11 08:34:34	DarkFox	I could try this

2014-07-06 22:21:33	hh4a	i know something thats not boring to see on TV, pron!
2014-07-06 22:21:34	dunz0r	bkc_: It's like asking you or me if we've played "kubb"...
2014-07-06 22:21:36	face_drop	I like sports
2014-07-06 22:21:40	face_drop	what can I say
2014-07-06 22:21:44	dunz0r	face_drop: I've never watched or played cricket :(
2014-07-06 22:21:45	bkc_	dunz0r: still racism ^.^
2014-07-06 22:21:47	dunz0r	I should.
2014-07-06 22:22:00	face_drop	dunz0r, sports are better than TV shows
2014-07-06 22:22:02	bkc_	is cricket different from Krocket?

2014-07-06 22:26:20	face_drop	I'm happy I could get a bunch of linux nerds talking about sports
2014-07-06 22:26:21	Arch-TK	##OpenGL is full of C++ noobs.
2014-07-06 22:26:26	face_drop	You have made my Sunday
2014-07-06 22:26:29	bkc_	Arch-TK: indeed
2014-07-06 22:26:31	Arch-TK	face_drop: I hate sports.
2014-07-06 22:26:37	dunz0r	face_drop: We only talk about cool sports though.
2014-07-06 22:26:39	bkc_	C++ makes sense with OpenGL :P
2014-07-06 22:26:41	face_drop	Arch-TK, well no one likes you
2014-07-06 22:26:44	Arch-TK	bkc_: No.
2014-07-06 22:26:48	Arch-TK	bkc_: IT makes -1 sense.
2014-07-06 22:26:52	Arch-TK	OpenGL is C.
2014-07-06 22:26:54	dunz0r	Pfft, I like Arch-TK
2014-07-06 22:26:54	Arch-TK	Not C++
2014-07-06 22:26:57	face_drop	dunz0r, are you a petrolhead?
2014-07-06 22:27:03	Arch-TK	I'm not a petrolhead.
2014-07-06 22:27:04	dunz0r	face_drop: A bit yes.
2014-07-06 22:27:06	bkc_	Arch-TK: everything in OpenGL is objects, hence OOP makes sense :)
2014-07-06 22:27:14	Arch-TK	bkc_: ... No???
2014-07-06 22:27:15	face_drop	dunz0r, I recently got a 2014 BMW
2014-07-06 22:27:17	face_drop	I <3 it
2014-07-06 22:27:20	bkc_	Arch-TK: yes...
2014-07-06 22:27:24	Arch-TK	bkc_: Everything in OpenGL is not objects.
2014-07-06 22:27:26	face_drop	2014 BMW 320i with a 6sp manaul
2014-07-06 22:27:30	Arch-TK	It's a context driven system.
2014-07-06 22:27:31	bkc_	Arch-TK: they are :)
2014-07-06 22:27:47	face_drop	my last car was a 1999 BMW 323i(I'm a bmw nerd) with a drift suspension
2014-07-06 22:27:49	Arch-TK	Any "objects" are limited to C representations of onjects.
2014-07-06 22:27:54	bkc_	Objects are handled with handles though, so one normally don't see the objects themselfs
2014-07-06 22:27:57	dunz0r	face_drop: Nice. A colleague of mine just got a 2008 428... it's awesome.
2014-07-06 22:27:58	Arch-TK	Context driven != object orientated.
2014-07-06 22:28:06	face_drop	dunz0r, very nice!
2014-07-06 22:28:07	Arch-TK	Yeah.
2014-07-06 22:28:12	dunz0r	Do want.
2014-07-06 22:28:17	bkc_	Arch-TK: it makes more sense in Objects though :)
2014-07-06 22:28:17	Arch-TK	That's part of a context driven design.
2014-07-06 22:28:20	face_drop	dunz0r, I drove a 428iM before I got my 320i
2014-07-06 22:28:20	Arch-TK	No.
2014-07-06 22:28:45	Arch-TK	C++ doesn't EVER make sense.
2014-07-06 22:28:55	Arch-TK	So it can't make sense with OpenGL
2014-07-06 22:28:59	bkc_	Arch-TK: you're forgetting that C has objects as well... structs...
2014-07-06 22:28:59	⚡	Companion runs over face_drop with a car... 
2014-07-06 22:29:05	Arch-TK	bkc_: Not objects.
2014-07-06 22:29:08	face_drop	dunz0r, I drove a bunch of cars before I settled on my 320i. I drove a 2005 BMW M3, 2006 Mitsubishi Lancer Evo MR IX, 2011 Subaru WRX STi Sedan, 2013 Ford Focus/Fiesta ST
2014-07-06 22:29:17	Arch-TK	bkc_: Well, "objects"
2014-07-06 22:29:29	bkc_	and C++ with RAII makes buttloads of sense when working with OpenGL :)
2014-07-06 22:29:30	Arch-TK	bkc_: But these objects aren't something C++ deals better with.
2014-07-06 22:29:42	acidfrost	bkc_: heh actually C++ class == C++ struct 
2014-07-06 22:29:47	bkc_	acidfrost: erm
2014-07-06 22:29:48	dunz0r	face_drop: 320... that's a 4 or 5 cylinder engine right?

2014-07-06 22:30:30	face_drop	its a beastly 4cylinder
2014-07-06 22:30:35	face_drop	180HP and 200Ft*Ibs of Torque
2014-07-06 22:30:36	bkc_	320, 3==3doors, 20=20dl engine

2014-07-06 22:31:47	acidfrost	only difference I believe is that structs don't do inheritance I think

2014-07-06 22:32:12	bkc_	acidfrost: the _only_ difference between Class and Struct in C++ is that in Class everything is private by default, while in Struct they're public by default
2014-07-06 22:32:19	bkc_	hence C++ Class ~= C++ Struct
2014-07-06 22:32:24	face_drop	dunz0r, check out the Ford Focus and Fiesta ST
2014-07-06 22:32:25	bkc_	and != C Struct

2014-07-06 22:32:49	bkc_	 
2014-07-06 22:32:50	acidfrost	bkc_: ofc C doesn't have classes, nor the public: private: protected: keywords ;p
2014-07-06 22:32:53	face_drop	dunz0r, I didn't before I stood next to it and drove it
2014-07-06 22:32:55	bkc_	acidfrost: they do
2014-07-06 22:33:08	bkc_	C has structs, and public/private
2014-07-06 22:33:13	bkc_	iirc
2014-07-06 22:33:15	acidfrost	bkc_: oh ? I've never seen them used 
2014-07-06 22:33:25	halosghost	bkc_: C has structs
2014-07-06 22:33:28	acidfrost	bkc_: unless its a C11 thing
2014-07-06 22:33:31	halosghost	it doesn't have private/public
2014-07-06 22:33:50	bkc_	erm, nvm, C doesn't have private/public
2014-07-06 22:34:00	bkc_	since that'd make no sense
2014-07-06 22:34:01	halosghost	but C does have structs
2014-07-06 22:34:02	acidfrost	thought so ;p 
2014-07-06 22:34:08	bkc_	indeed C has structs
2014-07-06 22:34:10	acidfrost	well ofc 
2014-07-06 22:34:20	halosghost	and structs are all you should need
2014-07-06 22:34:25	taotetek	C has static, which can be used a bit like private kind of.
2014-07-06 22:34:33	halosghost	taotetek: kind of
2014-07-06 22:34:42	bkc_	taotetek: how would that work? o.O
2014-07-06 22:34:49	acidfrost	?
2014-07-06 22:35:01	Arch-TK	bkc_: ...
2014-07-06 22:35:08	bkc_	Arch-TK: ?
2014-07-06 22:35:09	halosghost	bkc_: I mean, you can exploit scope to make faux access specification
2014-07-06 22:35:17	bkc_	ooh right
2014-07-06 22:35:20	Arch-TK	bkc_: static in C means visible only within the current file, (if used outside a block)
2014-07-06 22:35:30	Arch-TK	inside a block it means that the variable is visible and persistant throughout that block.
2014-07-06 22:35:31	bkc_	Arch-TK: wat
2014-07-06 22:35:39	bkc_	yeah
2014-07-06 22:35:48	halosghost	so, static != private; more like protected
2014-07-06 22:36:04	bkc_	but that doesn't really work like protected/private in C++ Classes/Structs
2014-07-06 22:36:11	bkc_	not the same at all tbh

2014-07-06 22:36:25	halosghost	I was thinking in terms of Java
2014-07-06 22:36:25	bkc_	they'd work more like static protected in C++ Class/Struct :P
2014-07-06 22:36:26	Arch-TK	Basically.
2014-07-06 22:36:28	halosghost	I'm not familiar with C++
2014-07-06 22:36:37	taotetek	we do pseudo class like stuff in czmq
2014-07-06 22:36:46	Arch-TK	No, c++ doesn't "make more sense" with OpenGL.
2014-07-06 22:36:55	Arch-TK	That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard.
2014-07-06 22:36:58	bkc_	taotetek: ooh right, opauqe members...
2014-07-06 22:37:08	bkc_	Arch-TK: OOP makes more sense with OpenGL :)
2014-07-06 22:37:08	Arch-TK	OpenGL makes the most sense in C by default because it is C.
2014-07-06 22:37:18	bkc_	erm, OpenGL isn't C...
2014-07-06 22:37:23	bkc_	OpenGL is a fucking spec...
2014-07-06 22:37:24	Arch-TK	It might make "some" sense in C++
2014-07-06 22:37:27	bkc_	not an implemetnation
2014-07-06 22:37:31	bkc_	implementatino*
2014-07-06 22:37:37	Arch-TK	Aren't most the implementations C?
2014-07-06 22:37:38	halosghost	taotetek: heh; nice use of self
2014-07-06 22:37:43	bkc_	Arch-TK: nope
2014-07-06 22:37:54	bkc_	OpenGL doesn't define or handle any implementations at all
2014-07-06 22:38:05	halosghost	mmmmm, pseudo OOP
2014-07-06 22:38:06	Arch-TK	I understand that.
2014-07-06 22:38:07	bkc_	hence why most crap is "implementaiton specific"
2014-07-06 22:38:30	bkc_	or "implementation dependant"
2014-07-06 22:38:30	taotetek	halosghost: yeah that's our coding convention for czmq
2014-07-06 22:38:34	halosghost	nice
2014-07-06 22:38:54	halosghost	I see little reason to use stdbool
2014-07-06 22:39:04	pld	hugh laurie isn't doing much these days is he?
2014-07-06 22:39:19	halosghost	a boolean in stdbool isn't any smaller than a char
2014-07-06 22:39:27	halosghost	so, the only difference is the name
2014-07-06 22:39:33	Arch-TK	bkc_: I'm pretty sure it was designed with C in mind initially though.
2014-07-06 22:39:35	bkc_	Arch-TK: Thinking in Objects makes buttloads of sense in OpenGL, and RAII makes OpenGL easier...
2014-07-06 22:39:37	bkc_	it is
2014-07-06 22:39:39	bkc_	was*
2014-07-06 22:39:48	Arch-TK	Yeah.
2014-07-06 22:39:55	Arch-TK	So it still makes most sense in C.
2014-07-06 22:40:00	bkc_	-.-
2014-07-06 22:40:01	taotetek	better walk the dogs back later o/
2014-07-06 22:40:14	Arch-TK	The so called "objects" are context driven items.
2014-07-06 22:40:20	Arch-TK	They're just like structs.
2014-07-06 22:40:28	Arch-TK	On which you can act using functions.
2014-07-06 22:40:31	bkc_	it's a state-machine
2014-07-06 22:40:35	Arch-TK	You can do the same in any bog standard shit.
2014-07-06 22:40:39	Arch-TK	Yes, context driven.
2014-07-06 22:40:46	bkc_	state driven
2014-07-06 22:40:51	Arch-TK	Any change within the context is persistant and global.
2014-07-06 22:40:56	halosghost	taotetek: peace and love
2014-07-06 22:40:56	Arch-TK	Which is what a state engine is you muppet.
2014-07-06 22:41:10	bkc_	lol
2014-07-06 22:41:52	bkc_	stop confusing me by saying Context, which is a state in itself in OpenGL ^.^
2014-07-06 22:42:07	bkc_	or rather, the state is contained to a Context
2014-07-06 22:42:31	Arch-TK	Yes.
2014-07-06 22:42:33	Arch-TK	That's how...
2014-07-06 22:42:36	Arch-TK	*facepalm*
2014-07-06 22:42:48	acidfrost	so a context is basically a localized state then ?(with opengl) 
2014-07-06 22:42:49	Arch-TK	A context of a state engine is still a context.
2014-07-06 22:42:55	Arch-TK	Basically acidfrost 
2014-07-06 22:42:59	bkc_	yes
2014-07-06 22:43:07	bkc_	so it's state-driven, and context contained
2014-07-06 22:43:12	bkc_	not context driven :&
2014-07-06 22:43:13	bkc_	:/*
2014-07-06 22:43:24	Arch-TK	context driven design works on the idea that whatever function you run actually changes a global state of the program, in a background (or manually created) context.
2014-07-06 22:43:26	bkc_	stop using made up words
2014-07-06 22:43:47	face_drop	quick question- if I want to start a shell script on start, I'm modifying my .xinitrc to call my script(its to change my wallpaper). So do just point it to where the script is and it executes?

2014-07-06 22:46:26	bkc_	Arch-TK: lightweight in this sentance is a modifier, hence 'an' is put on 'image'...

2014-07-06 22:46:50	bkc_	halosghost: really?
2014-07-06 22:46:51	halosghost	it should be "a"

2014-07-06 22:47:10	Arch-TK	bkc_: It doesn't matter how you think english works, if it doesn't sound right, it's probably wrong.

2014-07-06 22:47:15	Arch-TK	And that's how english works.
2014-07-06 22:47:18	mankypirate	ululul
2014-07-06 22:47:21	halosghost	bkc_: the only separation between "a" and "an" is whether or not the next word is pronounced with a vowel sound at the beginning
2014-07-06 22:47:22	Arch-TK	If it doesn't sound right, you're probably doing it wrong.

2014-07-07 00:33:32	Achillion	I'm thinking it would be nice to have a tool, perhaps a frontend for ecryptfs, that encrypts configuration/data directories separately and has a nice way of managing them (list, mount, unmount etc). What would be very nice would be to be able to use it for some programs which have sensitive information in their configuration directories (firefox, thunderbird). You would keep your ~/.firefox in an
2014-07-07 00:33:34	Achillion	encrypted directory and on launch (perhaps launch with a prefix, like "decfs firefox") that would popup a password dialogue, mount the encrypted ~/.firefox directory launch and unmount it when firefox closes
2014-07-07 00:33:40	Achillion	Anything like that, or should I make it?
2014-07-07 00:34:08	Lehvyn	Make it. I'd use it.
2014-07-07 00:34:25	Achillion	Not the worst idea, is it?

2014-07-07 00:36:05	Lehvyn	Seems fine to me. I'm just lazy; easier to get other people to do it for me. =x
2014-07-07 00:36:51	Achillion	I'm just asking because usually when I get an idea like this, there's an implementation for it already, or an alternative
2014-07-07 00:37:30	Lehvyn	I personally haven't seen anything like it, but I haven't looked either. Sorry.

2014-07-12 17:20:40	+Arch-TK	Time to make an .uxif image format.

2014-07-12 17:22:17	+mankypirate	so fucking good
2014-07-12 17:22:19	+Arch-TK	dagle: It could be compressed.

2014-07-12 17:22:30	+Arch-TK	or some other compression.
2014-07-12 17:22:59	+Arch-TK	I guess xif also makes sense.
2014-07-12 17:23:02	+mankypirate	imagine becoming a muslim and giving up bacon
2014-07-12 17:23:10	+Arch-TK	Since xcb doesn't support dirrectly giving it compressed images.

2014-07-13 09:20:30	GermainZ	Is it meta?
2014-07-13 09:20:53	GermainZ	Well, ^A[ seems to be meta, ^A[[ meta2… ^A? backspace… not sure what to search for if I want a list, though
2014-07-13 09:23:04	James_T	^ is CONTROL
2014-07-13 09:23:14	James_T	lol
2014-07-13 09:23:19	GermainZ	It's showing as ^A (single char)

2014-07-13 09:25:30	omp	that should be control-a, no?
2014-07-13 09:26:18	GermainZ	Nope
2014-07-13 09:26:32	GermainZ	This is all in WeeChat, but AFAIK it's sending the raw codes
2014-07-13 09:26:51	GermainZ	ctrl-a is ^AA (first ^A is literal)
2014-07-13 09:28:15	halosghost	^A == Ctrl + A
2014-07-13 09:28:20	halosghost	^ == Ctrl
2014-07-13 09:28:54	GermainZ	When I say ^A, I don't mean '^' followed by an 'A'
2014-07-13 09:28:56	GermainZ	It's one character

2014-07-13 09:29:13	GermainZ	Yes
2014-07-13 09:29:14	halosghost	it's still the same thing

2014-07-13 09:30:14	omp	you see it where?
2014-07-13 09:30:33	GermainZ	In a Python script for WeeChat that intercepts all of the keys!
2014-07-13 09:30:37	halosghost	^A is console interrupt or start of heading
2014-07-13 09:30:51	GermainZ	I'm writing it to file since ncurses can't display those character correctly, apparently
2014-07-13 09:31:08	GermainZ	(in ncurses I see a space instead of ^A)

2014-07-13 22:20:17	@grawity	my guess is that Chromium wants to support Wayland, meanwhile NPAPI has a hard dependency on X
2014-07-13 22:20:17	pythonsnake	me too*
2014-07-13 22:20:19	Nece228	grawity: yeah, but what to do if i need java to log in to my government or bank account?
2014-07-13 22:20:36	@grawity	(like, the NPAPI *protocol* requires X on Unix-like systems)
2014-07-13 22:21:02	@grawity	Nece228: then you use Firefox, and keep writing complaints to that account's managers that they force you to use a technology that has had *heaps* of security holes in the past few years
2014-07-13 22:21:03	pythonsnake	grawity: would you happen to know how to change chrome's fonts?
2014-07-13 22:21:08	pythonsnake	ilke the tab font
2014-07-13 22:21:08	GI_Jack	they can't port it to wayland?
2014-07-13 22:21:19	@grawity	pythonsnake: no
2014-07-13 22:21:23	pythonsnake	ok
2014-07-13 22:21:27	@grawity	pythonsnake: those are taken from the system theme
2014-07-13 22:21:35	@grawity	GI_Jack: port what?
2014-07-13 22:22:07	GI_Jack	NPAPI?
2014-07-13 22:22:21	@grawity	if you "ported" NPAPI to Wayland, then it wouldn't be NPAPI anymore, because it would be incompatible with existing NPAPI plugins
2014-07-13 22:22:29	@grawity	because the current NPAPI specifies the use of X11
2014-07-13 22:22:34	Nece228	grawity: yes, thats what i do now. its really stupid on how they use that crappy technology for such important things, at least in Denmark and Norway you need to have java installed if you wanna manage your taxes on web
2014-07-13 22:22:41	@grawity	so you have to invent a new embedding protocol anyway
2014-07-13 22:22:46	@grawity	and Chrome has that – it's called PPAPI

2014-07-13 22:23:16	@grawity	so you could say they *did* "port" NPAPI to Wayland.

2014-07-14 00:22:45	+Arch-TK	It's the worst attempt at a perlin noise generator that I've ever seen.
2014-07-14 00:22:49	halosghost	eww

2014-07-14 00:23:19	+Arch-TK	At any point...
2014-07-14 00:23:30	halosghost	hmm, I could make a pink noise generator
2014-07-14 00:23:34	halosghost	that'd be useful

2014-07-14 00:25:15	halosghost	though, I can generate white noise with aplay
2014-07-14 00:25:48	+Arch-TK	halosghost: If pink noise can be modelled as a 1D function.

2014-07-14 00:29:58	+Arch-TK	I'm still left wondering..;
2014-07-14 00:30:09	+Arch-TK	how does minecraft generate things predictably, but also using chunks...?
2014-07-14 00:30:16	◥	fckr (~fckr@65.26.68.160) has joined #archlinux-offtopic
2014-07-14 00:30:20	+Arch-TK	I mean..
2014-07-14 00:30:22	+Arch-TK	Sure...
2014-07-14 00:30:30	+Arch-TK	You can generate a predefined area the same way 10 times...
2014-07-14 00:30:38	+Arch-TK	But if you generate one are, and then an area next to it.
2014-07-14 00:30:44	+Arch-TK	And those two areas fit together.
2014-07-14 00:30:48	+Arch-TK	And then do that to a few more areas.
2014-07-14 00:30:58	+Arch-TK	And then when you do the same but do the areas in a different order.
2014-07-14 00:31:02	+Arch-TK	It still ends up looking the same.
2014-07-14 00:31:06	+Arch-TK	I can only guess that actually.
2014-07-14 00:31:13	+Arch-TK	It just takes some "seed" value.
2014-07-14 00:31:19	+Arch-TK	And doesn't use a standard random gen...
2014-07-14 00:31:31	+Arch-TK	It takes the two coordinates, the seed, and mashes them together to get a value.
2014-07-14 00:31:46	+Arch-TK	Which would be predictable, would mesh together, would be order independant... etc...
2014-07-14 00:31:54	+Arch-TK	So basically.
2014-07-14 00:32:01	+Arch-TK	It's srand with seed * x * y or something
2014-07-14 00:32:05	+Arch-TK	and then rand()#
2014-07-14 00:32:11	+Arch-TK	and then rinse and repeat.
2014-07-14 00:32:19	+Arch-TK	But rand() is overkill for that...
2014-07-14 00:32:21	+Arch-TK	Right.
2014-07-14 00:32:27	+Arch-TK	So my perlin noise generator needs to be predictable.

2014-07-14 17:12:55	halosghost	also, if you're going to use silly spacing/bracing, you should at least be consistent
2014-07-14 17:13:25	halosghost	dunz0r: bad? no; but can be made entirely unnecessary with good design? yes

2014-07-14 17:15:23	dagle	Well, it's nicer to have semicolons when you write in a nonindented enviroment.

2014-07-14 17:15:48	halosghost	oi?
2014-07-14 17:16:08	dagle	Semicolons are there for a reason, they are useful from times to times.
2014-07-14 17:16:08	halosghost	carharttjimmy: also, does that last thing you pasted work?
2014-07-14 17:16:08	dagle	Same as in haskell.
2014-07-14 17:16:10	dunz0r	To me, return a; is a lot clearer, but that's because I don't know that much rust yet.
2014-07-14 17:16:12	wasamasa	meh
2014-07-14 17:16:20	halosghost	carharttjimmy: it looks like if a > n, it'll loop forever

2014-07-14 17:16:34	dagle	dunz0r: Same in go, though you don't have to do it.
2014-07-14 17:17:12	halosghost	dagle: I completely agree, but being able to exclude them is a feature

2014-07-14 17:17:12	dunz0r	As a low level C hobby coder not using return feels quite weird :)

2014-07-14 17:17:27	+carharttjimmy	eventually it terminates when a < n or n = a
2014-07-14 17:18:04	dagle	dunz0r: Use haskell, we use return all the time!
2014-07-14 17:18:04	halosghost	dagle: no idea what you're talking about; but I was talking about carharttjimmy's code
2014-07-14 17:18:04	halosghost	carharttjimmy: when would that happen? I see no code that modifies a or n
2014-07-14 17:18:04	dagle	halosghost: "Well, it's nicer to have semicolons when you write in a nonindented enviroment."
2014-07-14 17:18:05	dunz0r	dagle: But I can't use Haskell for anything.

2014-07-14 17:18:28	halosghost	dagle: … k
2014-07-14 17:18:40	dagle	Irc is pretty horrible for writing indented code imo.
2014-07-14 17:18:50	dagle	Hence, ";" makes sense.

2014-07-14 21:57:53	body	after, they wrote fibo.fib(1000) , with the output of 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987
2014-07-14 21:58:10	body	but me, hwo can i know what fibo have inside, and what fibo.fib does ? foe example

2014-07-14 21:59:47	acidfrost	also that but iirc there is no fibo module that appears to be a sample module
2014-07-14 22:00:17	diegoviola	why would anyone use manjaro and not just arch? strange...
2014-07-14 22:00:33	acidfrost	!manjaro
2014-07-14 22:00:34	phrik	manjaro does a lot of things differently from what arch does. ask in #manjaro
2014-07-14 22:00:43	body	diegoviola: because the don't know how to get arch running, i done that before, when i started using linux
2014-07-14 22:00:57	body	it's out of the box
2014-07-14 22:01:12	acidfrost	its not rocket science to do an install
2014-07-14 22:01:42	body	ye, i had a pretty cool install story ^^

2014-07-14 22:02:14	acidfrost	it might be intimidating yes, hard no (unless you have a broadcom wifi chip and no other computers and can only access internet via wifi then its hard) 
2014-07-14 22:03:09	body	after a while playing with manjaro in dualboot with windows, i fuched up my hdd, and i left off  with no backup , only with a phone connected to wifi , and a cd with arch
2014-07-14 22:03:10	diegoviola	I see
2014-07-14 22:03:28	body	and then i started step by step installing arch xd
2014-07-14 22:03:34	acidfrost	body: anyhow as to your original problems fibo.fib appears to print the fibonacci sequence up to a certain number 
2014-07-14 22:03:53	body	oh, acidfrost ok
2014-07-14 22:04:00	body	so, for example another module
2014-07-14 22:04:07	body	give me one example acidfrost 
2014-07-14 22:04:08	diegoviola	yeah I have nothing against manjaro, if it helps people to start with arch then it's all good
2014-07-14 22:04:10	acidfrost	body: assuming that module is present on your system(which I don't know it sounds like an example) you can just read it with vim to learn the source
2014-07-14 22:04:24	body	aaa
2014-07-14 22:04:33	body	but when the module is big
2014-07-14 22:04:35	acidfrost	body: math is a good module 
2014-07-14 22:04:56	body	like .... qt
2014-07-14 22:05:14	body	if i vim into it, i get crazy reading all that stuff
2014-07-14 22:05:35	acidfrost	err well actually math appears to be a compiled in python module
2014-07-14 22:05:36	body	or this is the procedure ?
2014-07-14 22:05:39	diegoviola	aren't there alternative installers for arch? for those who find pacstrap intimidating?
2014-07-14 22:05:55	john_f	read the pyqt docs
2014-07-14 22:05:57	body	diegoviola: yes there are
2014-07-14 22:06:06	acidfrost	body: if you try to read a binary like qt<something...>.so you will see garbage
2014-07-14 22:06:11	diegoviola	I see
2014-07-14 22:06:29	acidfrost	because that is the ASCII representation of the bytes that make up the program
2014-07-14 22:06:45	acidfrost	give or take some unprintable bytes
2014-07-14 22:07:09	body	1 sec guys brb
2014-07-14 22:07:10	acidfrost	if it is a compiled module you can't see in it since it have been assembled into machine readable code
2014-07-14 22:08:08	body	ok so for pyqt, i finished here, http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/classes.html

2014-07-14 22:11:07	acidfrost	look the method I use is I look for tutorials first try to understand the order of operations then I look into the reference to figure out what I need to do what I want
2014-07-14 22:11:35	acidfrost	tutorials->man pages if any->reference->forums if you still don't know what you need to do what you want

2014-07-14 23:15:21	fckr	or you could just run irc in a multiplexed terminal, and switch panes for man... but that would be too easy

2014-07-14 23:34:28	@dagle	Still dont see why 3 layers of passing code gives breach hyper speeds and luakit is utterly slow.

2014-07-15 02:32:18	HarryMudd	due, i watched the whole series
2014-07-15 02:32:21	HarryMudd	dude
2014-07-15 02:32:26	acidfrost	also will ferrel as ashely schafer  is hilarious
2014-07-15 02:32:53	acidfrost	should've done a spinoff with him as the focus ;p
2014-07-15 02:33:15	HarryMudd	i only like will ferrell in small doses
2014-07-15 02:33:43	HarryMudd	actually, i'm kinda tired of his schtick
2014-07-15 02:34:34	acidfrost	Adam Sandler is pretty easy to start to hate after a while
2014-07-15 02:34:50	acidfrost	will ferrell I don't really get tired of 
2014-07-15 02:36:05	HarryMudd	yeah, adam sandler is on my don't wanna see any more list
2014-07-15 02:36:30	HarryMudd	as well as Ben Stiller
2014-07-15 02:36:40	acidfrost	oh god yeah tired of his stuff too
2014-07-15 02:37:56	HarryMudd	used to love Eddie Murphy until he got lame with the Dr. Dolittle and Nutty Professor crap
2014-07-15 02:38:14	acidfrost	yup still an alright dude though 
2014-07-15 02:38:47	acidfrost	kat williams is still pretty funny though if you watch his specials he kind of repeats the same jokes over and over
2014-07-15 02:39:21	acidfrost	Dave Chappelle was pretty funny don't know what he's doing now though 
2014-07-15 02:39:47	HarryMudd	chappelle seems like he lost his mind or sumthin

2014-07-15 02:40:19	HarryMudd	dude turned down millions to renew his show
2014-07-15 02:40:20	acidfrost	did he ?
2014-07-15 02:40:49	HarryMudd	look up a recent photo of him, he hit the gym bigtime
2014-07-15 02:40:50	acidfrost	I don't blame him though, you eventually get tired of the audience asking you to do rick james impersonations
2014-07-15 02:41:48	acidfrost	he had a pretty long run though so I reckon that if he didn't blow any of it he's probably sitting nice and comfortable still
2014-07-15 02:42:10	HarryMudd	hard to keep comedy fresh
2014-07-15 02:42:26	halosghost	Chappelle was incredibly not funny
2014-07-15 02:42:30	HarryMudd	that's why seinfeld went out while he was still on top
2014-07-15 02:42:35	acidfrost	yup

2014-07-15 02:45:25	acidfrost	HarryMudd: "dave I didn't know you like to get wet", "wet, what do you mean wet", "thats pcp ..."

2014-07-15 03:19:31	halosghost	looks like I might have to learn C# and .Net
2014-07-15 03:20:01	acidfrost	C# isn't bad, .Net I don't know much about 
2014-07-15 03:20:45	acidfrost	or rather I don't know exactly what .Net is since you have VB.net, C#.net, ASP.net etc 
2014-07-15 03:21:08	halosghost	yeah; I'm not sure which they mean either
2014-07-15 03:21:15	halosghost	I'm hoping it's not ASP
2014-07-15 03:21:24	acidfrost	lol
2014-07-15 03:21:26	halosghost	actually, I'm hoping for C#.net
2014-07-15 03:21:34	halosghost	because, I really don't want to do VB either
2014-07-15 03:22:57	acidfrost	ehh VB would certainly beat out ASP in my book 
2014-07-15 03:23:05	halosghost	that's a low bar
2014-07-15 03:23:10	acidfrost	if you had to choose between the two
2014-07-15 03:23:23	halosghost	I'd get high?
2014-07-15 03:23:37	halosghost	and write straight-up C because it's better
2014-07-15 03:24:02	acidfrost	tell them its weed.net ?

2014-07-15 03:28:58	Roukoswarf	2gb ram each
2014-07-15 03:29:38	Lehvyn	I could totally use that to host like 3 html pages.

2014-07-15 05:05:48	omp	halosghost: ugly?
2014-07-15 05:05:52	halosghost	yes
2014-07-15 05:05:53	halosghost	ugly
2014-07-15 05:05:54	omp	how so
2014-07-15 05:06:04	halosghost	the package manager is supposed to manage packages
2014-07-15 05:06:10	omp	?
2014-07-15 05:06:16	omp	i don't follow
2014-07-15 05:06:19	Caleb	omp: dont be a mccurran
2014-07-15 05:06:21	Caleb	lol
2014-07-15 05:06:35	omp	the package manager is managing packages
2014-07-15 05:06:39	halosghost	you shouldn't be `make install`ing to /usr (unless it's /usr/local)
2014-07-15 05:06:48	omp	halosghost: i never suggested that
2014-07-15 05:06:51	halosghost	and Calib is absolutely right
2014-07-15 05:06:54	halosghost	don't be mccurran
2014-07-15 05:07:06	omp	halosghost: you make install to any directory of your choosing
2014-07-15 05:07:13	omp	halosghost: and then merge that directory to / using your package manager
2014-07-15 05:07:17	Caleb	halosghost: how many times has he been told to install using pacman and he ignores everyone
2014-07-15 05:07:36	halosghost	Caleb: just enough that the next time it happens, I'll be adding an /ignore rule
2014-07-15 05:07:57	Caleb	heh
2014-07-15 05:07:58	omp	that's like saying using 'pacman -U' is not using the package manager
2014-07-15 05:08:04	halosghost	omp: so, it merges files from anywhere to your system
2014-07-15 05:08:15	halosghost	omp: not even close
2014-07-15 05:08:18	omp	halosghost: it's like writing a PKGBUILD without actually writing the PKGBUILD
2014-07-15 05:08:24	halosghost	closer
2014-07-15 05:08:33	omp	halosghost: you give it a directory, a package name, a package version
2014-07-15 05:08:36	halosghost	except, there's no hash checking
2014-07-15 05:08:38	omp	halosghost: and it merges it to the system
2014-07-15 05:09:01	omp	which is one of the most convenient things about paludis imo
2014-07-15 05:09:10	omp	and paludis is the best package manager imo
2014-07-15 05:09:33	Caleb	makes you lazy haha
2014-07-15 05:09:34	omp	http://paludis.exherbo.org/clients/cave-import.html
2014-07-15 05:09:36	phrik	Title: Paludis, the Other Package Mangler (at paludis.exherbo.org)
2014-07-15 05:10:26	omp	well, why go through the hassle of writing a PKGBUILD if i'm going to be installing something once
2014-07-15 05:10:37	omp	and i personally prefer using the packager manager to using /usr/local
2014-07-15 05:10:39	Caleb	who knows
2014-07-15 05:10:41	omp	because it feels cleaner
2014-07-15 05:10:49	halosghost	well, that certainly makes no sense for a rolling-release distro
2014-07-15 05:10:56	omp	incorrect
2014-07-15 05:11:04	halosghost	…
2014-07-15 05:11:07	omp	...
2014-07-15 05:11:17	omp	can you give me a reason why this is not a good feature?
2014-07-15 05:11:51	halosghost	no file integrity checks; "installing something only once" doesn't exist in rolling-release
2014-07-15 05:11:56	halosghost	how about those two?
2014-07-15 05:12:24	omp	do you have file integrity checks when you manually install something to a local directory or to /usr/local? no

2014-07-16 23:26:30	ptdel	meepo never seemed to really make the cut with all the matches i saw
2014-07-16 23:27:03	dagle	Meepo is really strong, but is so easly counterpicked.
2014-07-16 23:28:17	ptdel	yeah I don't think I play nearly enough to have a grasp on the nuances (not sure i care to either--it's just a game for me) but it definitely piqued my interest to see it all presented by talented players
2014-07-16 23:28:38	wasamasa	pld: I dunno, it's just that you keep posting imgur links and such with headlines à la clickhole

2014-07-16 23:32:12	wasamasa	Arch-TK: he found out about computers and was impressed how much even weak ones can calculate
2014-07-16 23:32:21	wasamasa	Arch-TK: then he combined his newly found interest with retrogames...

2014-07-16 23:32:32	wasamasa	Arch-TK: and started writing 32bit x86 asm emulators
2014-07-16 23:32:42	wasamasa	Arch-TK: for pretty much any console with really good debugging utils
2014-07-16 23:32:46	wasamasa	Arch-TK: and he sells them for a living

2014-07-16 23:33:08	+Arch-TK	I might go join him,,,
2014-07-16 23:33:09	wasamasa	Arch-TK: very unportable and windows-exclusive

2014-07-16 23:33:23	wasamasa	you might have heard of no$gba, the most famous of his works
2014-07-16 23:33:26	ptdel	Arch-TK, my thought would be that with the mul you're taking an integer, and with the add you're taking the contents of a register
2014-07-16 23:33:27	+Arch-TK	you want linux exclusive.
2014-07-16 23:33:37	wasamasa	Arch-TK: well, that's why I don't really care about him
2014-07-16 23:33:57	+Arch-TK	ptdel: I'll try adding some "word" directives.
2014-07-16 23:34:06	+Arch-TK	I think they're meant to be directives.
2014-07-16 23:34:06	wasamasa	Arch-TK: except when I find some post by him on an emulation forum because he knows his shit and it's a bit sad to see him coding for a platform that will soon become irrelevant
2014-07-16 23:34:17	woddf2	wasamasa: I vaguely remember using NO$GMB once well over a decade ago.  (Now his pseudonym reminds me of that "no (Bob) Hope, no (Johnny) Cash, no (Steve) Jobs" joke.)

2014-09-01 06:41:31	polyzen	> how on earth can we compete with the mexicans??
2014-09-01 06:41:48	meskarune	and the pain and spasms get really bad if I have to keep my mouth open, plus I can only open it about 3/4 of an inch

2014-09-01 06:43:20	meskarune	so last time I went to the dentist, I took sedatives, and just cried as they worked as fast as possible, and then got morphine injections at the ER
2014-09-01 06:43:42	polyzen	that sucks
2014-09-01 06:43:44	meskarune	I'm trying to plan this out so its less of a disaster
2014-09-01 06:43:50	polyzen	so they need to use stronger stuff next time?
2014-09-01 06:43:58	meskarune	idk
2014-09-01 06:44:04	meskarune	think about how much tooth pain can hurt
2014-09-01 06:44:14	meskarune	and jaw shit is 1000x worse
2014-09-01 06:44:18	meskarune	there are so many nerves in there
2014-09-01 06:44:24	polyzen	tbh i've had shittons of gum pain
2014-09-01 06:44:37	polyzen	though it's weird, i had all four wisdom teeth taken out at once
2014-09-01 06:44:45	polyzen	didn't use the (weak) painkillers they gave me

2014-09-01 06:46:11	meskarune	I've had jaw pain that made me blackout, then I adapted and stopped blacking out, and then begged to be put into a coma. The morphine/toradol they gave me barely helped. Ended up having to get a nerve block, emergency surgery, and botox injections into the muslces
2014-09-01 06:46:25	meskarune	probably worst night of my life
2014-09-01 06:46:27	polyzen	omp, were they squishing your other teeth?

2014-09-01 06:47:26	omp	polyzen: i think they were all impacted
2014-09-01 06:47:31	omp	polyzen: but i've only removed the bottom ones

2014-09-01 06:48:46	polyzen	my dad has most of his teeth replaced. gma on mom's side has dentures
2014-09-01 06:48:50	⚡	omp just has an extra wisdom tooth on the top right or left, don't remember
2014-09-01 06:48:58	polyzen	that's kinda cool, meskarune
2014-09-01 06:49:05	omp	none of my upper wisdom teeth have erupted out of the gums
2014-09-01 06:49:16	meskarune	omp: so like, if you had a tooth removed, do you think the wisdom teeth would grow out?
2014-09-01 06:49:35	omp	no idear
2014-09-01 06:49:38	meskarune	hehe
2014-09-01 06:49:57	meskarune	I know a guy who's wisdom teeth just grew in like normal teeth. I guess he had room for them

2014-09-01 06:51:17	meskarune	I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 14, the dentist removed them before they were fully formed. I guess its easier to extract them that way or something
2014-09-01 06:51:22	omp	something like the bottom right there, i think
2014-09-01 06:52:07	meskarune	they come out in pieces since they aren't fully formed teeth

2014-11-13 04:04:54	tigrmesh	with beest

2014-11-13 04:05:01	beest	oh, so you didn't like her answer and asked us instead, awesome :P
2014-11-13 04:05:25	halosghost	beest: I trust this friend quite a bit
2014-11-13 04:05:54	tigrmesh	in your mind, what does "avoid trying to start anything" mean?
2014-11-13 04:06:07	beest	forge a non-pushy friendship and let her steer the course.
2014-11-13 04:06:32	halosghost	if I wasn't being clear, the person that gave me that advice was the friend who introduced us
2014-11-13 04:06:48	tigrmesh	+1 - *heavy* on the non-push
2014-11-13 04:06:55	halosghost	and as far as I can tell, she meant that I should avoid trying to engage in any kind of romantic relationship with this person
2014-11-13 04:07:07	Roukoswarf	i have no idea whats going on
