2014-11-15 01:29:46	jumanji	so there has to be some process that constantly monitors the celery queue, if empty? accept tasks from each user once. if not? block
2014-11-15 01:29:56	Ranieri_	hmm
2014-11-15 01:30:01	nedbat	Ranieri_: and, you have to get used to dealing with abstractions if you're going to program.  So at a certain point, you have to stop asking how it's working, and just accept that it does.
2014-11-15 01:30:01	keviv	jumanji: why not a list of queues like before?

2014-11-15 03:39:49	jakesyl	your only changing legit inside the function, not outside the function it has to be a paramater
2014-11-15 03:39:58	zachpanz88	dkog thanks
2014-11-15 03:40:23	dkog	zachpanz88: that's not how it works
2014-11-15 03:40:31	dkog	the var in the function doesn't exist after the function returns
2014-11-15 03:40:41	dkog	you have to capture the function return
2014-11-15 03:40:56	jakesyl	so legit = user_moves

2014-11-28 21:03:05	superkuh	Hi. I made a terrible mistake trying to install python2.7 standlone in virtualenv on Ubuntu 10.04. I removed it. But now my system python2.6 install is borked. When I "$which python" it returns, /usr/local/bin/python instead of the proper python install in /usr/bin/python. And all my python applications have stopped working. Is there a way to force python to use the proper install?

2014-12-01 15:30:33	sange	arkie: You define 'word' by enumerating over the list 'words' you create by splitting by whitespace.
2014-12-01 15:30:42	bokoboko	(dont know if thats possible)
2014-12-01 15:30:42	arkie	also, why does it execute as None is i do print lst.sort() instead of sorted(lst)?
2014-12-01 15:30:53	arkie	if*
2014-12-01 15:30:54	jorrit	arkie, sort returns None
2014-12-01 15:30:54	cdunklau	arkie: because the sort method modifies the list in-place

2014-12-01 15:34:04	bokoboko	I read somewhere that i have to call the init inside the decorator in order the decorator to work inside class but im not sure

2015-03-06 01:38:56	HTH	Hello, python pros :p Can anyone reccomend a library for visualization. Specifically  I'd like to be able to plot particles along 2 or three dimensions (moderately large, id like to be able to handle thousands of points at once). The main feature that I really would like however is the ability to do so in real time, if I was to be creating a 3d cube f.ex I'd like to be able to add a layer at a time, having the last layer fissapear. I have no issue implementing m

2015-04-03 07:30:45	Moose	But for things that succeed, yeah it's all automated.
2015-04-03 07:30:47	botnut	ideally - automated tests that are kept up by each member of the team - that each time you hit compile - they run against your code base and confirm its working - this way - the developer can ensure they haven't messed anything else up in the process of doing their job
2015-04-03 07:30:57	Moose	ej: Depends on your transmitter machine.

2015-04-03 07:33:04	malinoff	Moose, also, unit tests and ui tests should be separated
2015-04-03 07:33:09	Moose	malinoff: We do, but no not really. A developer can check in a feature and get it tested and while it's getting tested he works on something else.
2015-04-03 07:33:17	Toordog	_habnabit precompile or compile at execution?
2015-04-03 07:33:18	botnut	ui tests is more of a black box testing technique - where as - unit tests are more of a white box test
2015-04-03 07:33:22	_habnabit	ej, you can't know until you profile your code
2015-04-03 07:33:26	Toordog	ah sorry cpython, i misread
2015-04-03 07:33:38	Moose	malinoff: Our small group is 15 minutes, basic verification of functionality for a SPECIFIC component. That's really good in my opinion. But testing for regression is a 10 hour process.
2015-04-03 07:33:52	malinoff	Moose, then you're ok :)
2015-04-03 07:34:06	Moose	For the most part yes, but that 15 minutes isn't on a dev machine
2015-04-03 07:34:07	botnut	selenium scripts are generally slower - since you have network latency, website latency, etc etc, page loads etc etc
2015-04-03 07:34:11	Moose	It'd be around 4 hours on a dev machine

2015-04-03 12:08:08	xlament	kosh: so how does bandwidth even come into it
2015-04-03 12:08:13	jackhum	user will enter a word , my app will search it , parse it , and then store it offline
2015-04-03 12:08:25	kosh	because bandwidth has to be paid for
2015-04-03 12:08:30	kosh	server time has to be paid for

There is a bug in a dependency of that library, so I’ve forked it on github and made my own patched version.

2015-04-03 22:49:14	runciter	Berra: the reason i put that into the example was that if you chose to write a function in which you created an event listener for short-term use, you wouldn't leak memory

2015-04-04 07:27:42	Kirito	If I have an IRC bot that connects to multiple networks, but does not (and should not) directly share data between connections, would this be a reasonable use of multiprocessing? For each connection, create a new process. This would also give each connection a dedicated CPU to work on, spreading the load out between the networks. So this would make perfect sense, wouldn't it?

2015-04-04 07:41:48	Kirito	_habnabit, It's built around the irclib library. It can (I'm pretty sure anyways) handle multiple connections from a single process. But also, say I want to listen on other protocols when the bot is started. e.g. HTTP, XMPP. With Twisted, you can pretty much handle all of this easily. But since I'm not using Twisted, what would you do in a situation like this?
2015-04-04 07:42:08	Kirito	Would using multiple connections still be a bad idea?
2015-04-04 07:42:10	Kirito	er
2015-04-04 07:42:14	Kirito	multiple processes
2015-04-04 07:42:29	_habnabit	Kirito, i would use twisted. why wouldn't you use twisted?

2015-04-04 08:29:45	runciter	you'd get the repr of that tuple

2015-04-04 12:08:12	Desu	you would have to make a custom build target that does it

2015-04-04 14:20:47	ionelmc	nszceta_: what's immature about it?
2015-04-04 14:20:54	nszceta_	the author claims it is
2015-04-04 14:21:03	nszceta_	http://www.pyinvoke.org/

2015-04-04 14:21:18	nszceta_	nothing, I'd prefer to stick with python 3 whenever possible
2015-04-04 14:21:19	vreo	anyone use tweepy? im using it now and getting the error AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'OAuthHandler',  i asked in the tweepy irc channel but it seems dead :/
2015-04-04 14:21:34	moldy	nszceta_: seems to be a bad choice, if you ask me
2015-04-04 14:21:51	nszceta_	so it would be preferable to stick with python 2 and fabric, in your opinion?
2015-04-04 14:22:12	moldy	nszceta_: if the only problem you have with fabric is that it's py2, yes.
2015-04-04 14:22:16	nszceta_	ok
2015-04-04 14:22:27	Desu	port fabric :p
2015-04-04 14:22:42	nszceta_	invoke is written by the same author and it is the "next generation" from what I gather

2015-04-05 08:07:38	_habnabit	juicebag_, well, 'works' is relative. this code does no send-buffering or line-buffering or parsing

2015-04-05 08:08:27	juicebag_	alright
2015-04-05 08:09:48	_habnabit	juicebag_, just as an example, if someone put 'juicebot go away' somewhere in the topic of your channel, or set it as the motd of the irc server, your bot would immediately exit

I'd like to keep the terminal simple, just write text in for inputting commands, see output .. no need for scrolling etc. but if they are provided with little overhead for user (e.g. without having to learn 50 key combos to just do basic interaction) it's a decent extra

2015-04-05 09:24:58	jair	s1dev: I see.  What about IDE for the code development. Do you think if I will be learning python start with netbeans? or pycharm?
2015-04-05 09:25:04	jair	or anything else?
2015-04-05 09:25:18	s1dev	jair: I currently have pyCharm open
2015-04-05 09:26:12	jair	s1dev: I see what about netbeans? that is more focused on Java and PHP correct?
2015-04-05 09:26:46	s1dev	I haven't had any person experience with it beyond doing a bit a Java with it

2015-04-05 09:27:36	jair	I did installed pycharm 4.0.5
2015-04-05 09:28:04	jair	I am thinking about using python, html5, and css3
2015-04-05 09:28:17	jair	perhaps javascript
2015-04-05 09:28:30	The-Compiler	jair: for learning, I recommend just using a good text editor (say Notepad++ if you're on Windows), so you can focus on learning Python rather than some tools

2015-04-05 09:29:32	jair	so I guess I can use vim but will be nice to have a tool that can give me suggestions while typing python code
2015-04-05 09:29:57	s1dev	also I haven't heard of using Python like PHP before, but based on this http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/42868/how-to-use-python-as-a-server-language-from-a-php-perspective and the lack of results, it's not very popular
2015-04-05 09:29:58	The-Compiler	jair: IMHO, autocompletion does more harm than good when you're learning a language
2015-04-05 09:30:12	jair	like I said I have pycharm 4.0.5 and now I got a prompt about 4.0.6 being available
2015-04-05 09:31:00	The-Compiler	s1dev: what do you mean with using it "like PHP"?
2015-04-05 09:31:08	jair	The-Compiler: OK, so i believe that vim will be just enough
2015-04-05 09:31:49	s1dev	The-Compiler it would seem that jair wnats to use Python in place of PHP in a LAMP stack
2015-04-05 09:32:23	The-Compiler	s1dev: Using Python for web-stuff in general is very popular, usually with something like Django/Flask/Pyramid/...

2015-04-05 13:41:13	zahlman	3.x would be perfectly relevant to the discussion if people had started migrating at a sane time. That's on them. Now the PSF is hobbled by having to maintain two branches, *still*.
2015-04-05 13:41:37	plasteredparrot	in response to whoever said "it's as easy to rewrite in Scala from 2.x than to 3.x from 2.x" no, it isn't. Even for very large codebases
2015-04-05 13:41:52	ronny	zahlman: some people are still on 2.4 for arcane reasons,
2015-04-05 13:41:53	zahlman	The last time I felt like this was in the late 2000s when I was trying to figure out where the hell people were apparently *still* finding install CDs for *new* installations of visual studio 6.

2015-04-05 13:42:46	Wild_Cat	plasteredparrot: probably not in Scala, what with the changes in typing discipline. Clojure, though, I'm not so sure. And doing so gives is more compelling than rewriting in Py3.x, because it'd give me more bang for my buck.

2015-04-05 13:43:22	plasteredparrot	but 2.7 -> 3.4 is not rewriting IMO
2015-04-05 13:43:43	ronny	i suspect there are way more companies whose setup would make it more money efficient efficient to fork 2.7 at oel than to port to 3.x
2015-04-05 13:43:46	nanonyme	SilentGhost, ensurepip actually made sense since it means you can put most functionality into 3rd-party packages and migrate to 3.x easier
2015-04-05 13:43:52	zahlman	2.7->3.4 is orders of magnitude less complicated than Python -> Clojure. I'd rate it as considerably less complicated than Java -> C#.
2015-04-05 13:44:23	ronny	plasteredparrot: going from non python 3 to python3 supported can be as hard as a rewrite depending on the starting position
2015-04-05 13:44:54	SilentGhost	nanonyme: you'd still need to ensure that your packages are 3.x compatible, you'd still have to re-write same amount of code

2015-04-05 16:16:28	lvh	pie_: but sure you can do it
2015-04-05 16:16:39	jeffreylevesque	so, i'd query the memcache for the SVC object (pickled, i think), and if it doesn't exist, store in memcache, and output the SVC to use for prediction
2015-04-05 16:16:45	scottydelta	lvh, Peng , subprocess is producing some weird error when using in celery and I finally gave it up after trying to fix it for 4-5 hours, so thats why switching to os.system

Then, a user can create an SVM model from the database - but, i need the SVM model cached, so they can use it over and over, rather than regenerate the model

2015-04-05 19:48:57	nicksloan	nedbat: I think it could be. Seems to me that perhaps submodules should be auto-loaded from a package if they are to be automatically added to the namespace. Now, I don't really think that should happen, but it seems more consistent. This is related to when someone does python -c "import package; package.submodule.function();" and it doesn't work because they haven't loaded the submodule yet.

2015-04-05 19:50:28	nicksloan	that's a newbie gotcha, and you learn that you either explicitly import the submodule from your end-code, or you import the submodule into the package's namespace and then you can do that
2015-04-05 19:50:38	nedbat	Ilooo: why is that?

2015-04-05 19:51:31	nicksloan	so then, I think, having learned that, you'd be confused to find that sometimes modules get added to the namespace without you explicitly doing so somewhere.
