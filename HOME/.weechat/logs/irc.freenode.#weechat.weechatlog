2014-11-15 05:37:49	kba	anybody got any idea? this might not be strictly related to weechat, though
2014-11-15 05:38:09	ShawnR	kba: 99% chance it is not (99.999999% to be honest)
2014-11-15 05:38:10	kba	but if I'm logged into the machine just in the shell or in a new screen, it doesn't disconnect
2014-11-15 05:38:39	kba	a bit of a big percentage ;)
2014-11-15 05:38:42	ShawnR	is it while you are actively using the session or just if you leave it in a screen and come back to ti later to find that it is DCed?

2014-11-15 05:39:15	kba	but I've tried to diagnose it by leaving another shell connection open and it doesn't happen to that one
2014-11-15 05:39:38	kba	I don't recall exactly, but iwthin the last 2 minutes or so, yes
2014-11-15 05:39:51	ShawnR	do you connect locally or from WAN?
2014-11-15 05:40:02	kba	WAN
2014-11-15 05:40:35	ShawnR	does weechat lose connection to session, or are you just kicked out of the shell but never notice any issues with a log file from the IRC side of things?
2014-11-15 05:41:00	kba	it's in a screen, so weechat doesn't even know, so to speak
2014-11-15 05:41:07	kba	and I'm usually not kicked out, the shell jsut becomes unresponsive
2014-11-15 05:41:19	kba	then I co ctrl+a+d, to force disconnect and then reattach to the screen
2014-11-15 05:41:55	kba	in fact, sometimes when it happens, I've noticed that if I write something (while the screen isn't updating), then I'll come back to find that the text is still in the input field
2014-11-15 05:42:14	kba	i.e. I can still send data to the server, but not recieve it
2014-11-15 05:42:22	kba	also, this also happened with irssi back when I used it

2014-11-15 05:43:05	kba	whereas an empty shell doesn't
2014-11-15 05:43:09	gb	it's not screen or weechat at fault, mosh can overcome it some of the time
2014-11-15 05:43:12	kba	so if there is an outage, the shell rpobably won't notice
2014-11-15 05:43:18	kba	mosh?
2014-11-15 05:43:28	kba	mobile shell, right

2014-11-15 05:44:07	kba	I just don't feel like I should be using mosh instead of solving the problem
2014-11-15 05:44:33	gb	in any case there are heaps of different configuration tips/tricks you can try with ssh
2014-11-15 05:44:39	kba	weechat is running on a dedicated server in a data center, it's not because it has network outages, I'd assume

2014-11-15 05:46:16	kba	then I can see if that connection persists
2014-11-15 05:46:26	kba	if it does, then the problem must be with my client
2014-11-15 05:46:28	gb	i run mosh and ssh to the same session usually so i notice the differences :)
2014-11-15 05:46:31	kba	if it doesn't, then the problem must be with the server
2014-11-15 05:46:34	kba	right?
2014-11-15 05:47:00	kba	or I could just try to run weechat on another server

2014-11-15 05:48:51	gb	using -dr sometimes helps flush the buffers and fix things but not always
2014-11-15 05:49:01	kba	I'm not using -x

2014-11-15 05:49:55	kba	I don't follow. When I stat my screen session, I do: screen -admS freenode
2014-11-15 05:49:56	gb	when you reattach
2014-11-15 05:50:24	kba	I just do: ssh -t kba@<server> screen -rD freenode
2014-11-15 05:50:35	gb	i normally reattach with screen -x so i can see it from several routes on several machines at same time
2014-11-15 05:51:16	gb	some using mosh some forced to use ssh because mosh gets blocked by firewall

2014-11-15 05:53:17	kba	so it starts... wait what?

2014-11-15 05:54:24	kba	Ah, right. Well my server is stable enough
2014-11-15 05:55:11	kba	I just had a completely unrelated and morbid thought
2014-11-15 05:55:31	kba	I imagine many people would have done something like you over time, or possibly on a server
2014-11-15 05:55:45	kba	and at least somebody who's doing that must have died at some point
2014-11-15 05:55:47	gb	problem for me is if i am out bush or away from net connectivity for months at a time and server drops for whatever reason i miss whatever attempts at contact during that time if it doesn't cron backup by itself
2014-11-15 05:55:50	kba	so there are probably dead people connected to irc
2014-11-15 05:55:56	kba	I don't know why I thought of that...
2014-11-15 05:56:11	kba	yeah, I get it
2014-11-15 05:56:22	gb	hahaha nah not everyone uses irc
2014-11-15 05:56:36	gb	lotsa dead people on poobook though
2014-11-15 05:56:41	kba	sure they don't, but if it happened to you (god forbid and everythin)
2014-11-15 05:56:45	kba	somebody might not know
2014-11-15 05:56:59	kba	and you'd stay ircd for a while, a few years possible
2014-11-15 05:57:19	kba	if you're just using some work server or something
2014-11-15 05:57:20	gb	unlikely i've already been dead a few times :)
2014-11-15 05:57:33	kba	well there you have it!
2014-11-15 05:57:37	kba	at some point, you were the dead guy on irc
2014-11-15 05:58:12	kba	if poobook is fancy for facebook, then yeah, but they also have that "deceased" mode now I think
2014-11-15 05:58:17	gb	rotten hospitas keep putting me on life support till i am undead :)
2014-11-15 05:58:56	gb	but theres nothing much screen/weechat can do about the ssh issues
2014-11-15 05:59:05	kba	you're missing a hand and you keep dying... dude, maybe you should like, stop doing that
2014-11-15 05:59:23	kba	yeah, I guess I could try mosh
2014-11-15 06:01:11	kba	but it's not too bad now, I've gotten used to it, it's just ctrl+a+d, then type fn<enter>
2014-11-15 06:01:17	gb	i still have both hands but struggle to use either now
2014-11-15 06:01:49	kba	oh I thought you said that you only had one the other day
2014-11-15 06:02:02	gb	if you launch a new term with fn<enter> it should detach and kill old session anyhow
2014-11-15 06:02:30	kba	fn is just an alias for: ssh -t kba@<server> screen -x freenode
2014-11-15 06:02:50	gb	oh -x no it wont :)
2014-11-15 06:03:04	kba	I used -rD before, btu just changed it now to -x
2014-11-15 06:03:09	gb	if you used -dr it would kill the old session
2014-11-15 06:03:11	kba	maybe I shouldn't have if I'll end up with zombie listeners
2014-11-15 06:03:18	kba	yeah
2014-11-15 06:04:22	gb	i find -x is great for my needs but it might introduce further issues for you if you have some already
2014-11-15 06:04:45	kba	indeed, I'll reverse it
2014-11-15 06:05:08	gb	i notice when one route goes down because the screen freezez across all sessions
2014-11-15 06:05:35	gb	sometimes not always
2014-11-15 06:05:43	kba	what do you mean one route?
2014-11-15 06:06:20	gb	i use a 3g router and also access an adsl router on same lan to reach a vserve in a different country
2014-11-15 06:07:10	kba	you can't connec to the other country from your regular connection? wat
2014-11-15 06:07:23	gb	through different service providers they give me a way to reach email/weechat if one or other dies
2014-11-15 06:07:54	gb	my 3g connection is very dodgy and the adsl is not mine :)
2014-11-15 06:08:49	kba	I see
2014-11-15 06:09:06	gb	my 3g connection goes with me when i a on my boat, for some reason i have trouble using the dsl connection then :)
2014-11-15 06:09:35	kba	aye
2014-11-15 06:10:24	gb	with weechat i can have immediate connectivity with family, etc onboard and don't have to wait for email
2014-11-15 06:11:16	kba	most other people would probably use texting, iMessage or fb, but I get it ;)
2014-11-15 06:11:52	gb	yeah looking at using weetext but seems googles api has changed or broken it sumhow
2014-11-15 06:15:38	kba	hah, I meant without using weechat

2014-11-15 06:17:51	kba	:)
2014-11-15 06:20:23	gb	there is no quick fix to your issue i am afraid, a different provider might give you better usage but really depends on where the issues lie re ssh being killed off, only takes one wifi link in the mix between you and screen/weechat and i have found that's enough to cause problems
2014-11-15 06:21:03	gb	a pidgeon farts as it flies past :)
2014-11-15 06:21:20	kba	I'm connected through Mosh now
2014-11-15 06:21:24	kba	so maybe that is a fix
2014-11-15 06:21:35	kba	i doubt it's my provider, though
2014-11-15 06:21:37	gb	does your mouse work?
2014-11-15 06:21:41	kba	I've never experienced any issues otherwise
2014-11-15 06:21:46	kba	my mouse?
2014-11-15 06:21:53	kba	if you mean the weechat mouse, I don't use that
2014-11-15 06:21:59	gb	i use a perl line in my shell for it

2014-11-15 06:26:24	gb	you can see if the connection is dropping on a mosh connection screen/weechat too by running last user|less
2014-11-15 06:26:42	gb	it will display all the times mosh had to relaunch a connect

2014-11-15 06:28:22	gb	then ctrl a a to return to weechat
2014-11-15 06:29:21	gb	thats the whole point of scree/tmux to multiplex your terminal to run multiple programs at the same time
2014-11-15 06:30:11	kba	I'm just using it to keep my session alive
2014-11-15 06:31:03	gb	yes having a session die under a running program is pretty much an essiential part of multiplexing :)
2014-11-15 06:31:15	gb	not die rather
2014-11-15 06:33:29	gb	the other thing with mosh is if your connection does drop for an extended time it will tell you straight away with a timer bar across the top of your term till it reconnects

2015-08-13 13:36:13	TheDoc	not sure FlashCode
2015-08-13 13:36:19	TheDoc	i did do stuff like that last night
2015-08-13 13:36:28	TheDoc	i put in version 1.2.2 I think of all the plugins
2015-08-13 13:36:31	TheDoc	and it still didnt seem to work
2015-08-13 13:36:36	TheDoc	then i went and found perl:encode or something
2015-08-13 13:36:49	TheDoc	i didn't think it was working, but then i login this morning and there is buffer.pl and some other bits
2015-08-13 13:37:03	TheDoc	so it might have been that i did update something, and just needed to restart pc or cygwin which i didnt do
2015-08-13 13:37:20	TheDoc	i didnt do a full reinstall of cygwin anyway, thats for sure
2015-08-13 13:37:25	TheDoc	was kinda resound to just doing without :D

2015-08-13 13:39:07	TheDoc	lots of communities im interested in on there, mostly world of warcraft stuff
2015-08-13 13:40:55	TheDoc	going to see if today I can get bitlbee in, setup a twitter feed window :D
2015-08-13 13:41:04	zutto	quakenet is still very active place for many kinds of channels
2015-08-13 13:41:29	TheDoc	must admit, this setup was definitly easier on the raspberry pi :D
2015-08-13 13:41:46	TheDoc	yeah zutto it was always the place to go for gaming for years, still a lot of active communities there
2015-08-13 13:41:53	TheDoc	im only on freenode for this channel :D
2015-08-13 13:42:06	zutto	for non-gaming related things too
2015-08-13 13:42:39	zutto	was the go-to network in early 2k's for everything
2015-08-13 13:42:57	zutto	all the others, especially ircnet was something that people detested a lot
2015-08-13 13:45:50	Nicd-	well ircnet is terrible
2015-08-13 13:45:53	TheDoc	aw bitlbee isnt supported for windows
2015-08-13 13:45:56	Nicd-	so that's no surprise :P
2015-08-13 13:46:02	TheDoc	may very well have to get that pi up and running again :'(
2015-08-13 13:46:08	zutto	its so sad that so many channels are still in ircnet
2015-08-13 13:47:19	Nicd-	took me 5 minutes to get trusts for quakenet, took 3 months to get I-lines for ircnet :D
2015-08-13 13:48:05	@FlashCode	TheDoc: I think restarting windows and/or cygwin could have helped for this problem
2015-08-13 13:49:19	TheDoc	probably it FlashCode
2015-08-13 13:50:41	zutto	Nicd-: good networks offer trusts very fast :P

2015-08-13 23:41:29	moviuro	Hi all! I got, like, a tiny (issue with) weechat: http://wstaw.org/m/2015/08/13/plasma-desktopEt5101.png
2015-08-13 23:41:58	moviuro	how can I fix that? (weechat starts in tmux while it's not yet attached)
2015-08-13 23:42:21	moviuro	Hmmm, splitting tmux and closing the new pane does the job
2015-08-13 23:42:32	evaryont	moviuro: do you have any other tmux sessions attached?
2015-08-13 23:42:42	moviuro	nope evaryont
2015-08-13 23:42:59	meingtsla	I suspect that may be a tmux issue, because I have seen that issue occur when I have tmux open up htop on startup for example
2015-08-13 23:43:35	farn	moviuro: what does /debug term say?
2015-08-13 23:44:08	moviuro	after resizing: TERM='screen', size: 245x62
2015-08-13 23:44:32	moviuro	I'll have to kill tmux and restart it to trigger the bug anew, I think
2015-08-13 23:46:30	farn	I was mostly interested in the TERM but that looks fine
2015-08-13 23:46:41	farn	I don't know if a wrong TERM outside of tmux could cause that
2015-08-13 23:46:53	farn	you could also try ctrl-L next time
2015-08-13 23:47:06	evaryont	the regex for /filter, does that grab all remaining arguments? I don't need to try escaping spaces, or deal with quoting?

2015-08-14 17:37:20	Nicd-	personally I have been designing a client like that (in my head only), where you would run the core on a server and then client UIs that would connect to it (graphically or in text mode)
2015-08-14 17:37:30	Zarthus	setting up your relay would be more effort than generating a ssh key :X

2015-08-15 11:22:53	gb	could probably even start bitlbee from with weechat from command after plugins or similar even
2015-08-15 11:23:28	gb	or is there some reason this would be a bad idea?
2015-08-15 11:28:25	@FlashCode	bitlbee is a separate daemon, why starting it from weechat?
2015-08-15 11:28:36	@FlashCode	your OS should start it on boot, no?
2015-08-15 11:29:06	@FlashCode	and in weechat it's just a server like all other, with possibly autoconnect enabled

2015-08-15 11:35:46	gb	FlashCode: so i can store it's config as a user instead of root
2015-08-15 11:36:38	gb	not much point running it as root for a single user anyhow
2015-08-15 11:36:40	@FlashCode	which config do you mean, accounts in bitlbee?
2015-08-15 11:37:05	gb	everything stored in /etc/bitlbee but accounts definitely
2015-08-15 11:37:21	@FlashCode	I'm not sure if bitlbee can start as a regular user
2015-08-15 11:37:30	@FlashCode	you should check their docs
2015-08-15 11:37:41	gb	ok well i will play with it anyhow
2015-08-15 11:37:53	gb	their manpage suggests -d
2015-08-15 11:38:02	@FlashCode	here bitlbee runs as a standard daemon, just for my user
2015-08-15 11:38:07	@FlashCode	not a problem anyway
2015-08-15 11:38:59	gb	i like to keep all my configuration data so i can easilly backup and restore regardless of mahine/os i am using
2015-08-15 11:40:00	gb	especially essential on machines i do not have access to root on like virtual servers
2015-08-15 11:40:20	@FlashCode	I see
2015-08-15 11:41:24	gb	i seldom use bitlbee but it looks to be one way out of the present issue i have with the telco/sms issue i have
2015-08-15 11:42:11	gb	as you know my typing in general sucks, but typing on a phone in sms is even worse
2015-08-15 11:43:19	gb	so going to try and setup a mobile weechat/bitlbee i can use on x0/new computer through phone instead
2015-08-15 11:44:10	Raku_	I really wish there was a nice way to use weechat on mobile
2015-08-15 11:44:18	Raku_	But the screens are too small
2015-08-15 11:44:55	Mikaela	/bar toggle buffers
2015-08-15 11:44:56	Mikaela	/bar toggle nicklist
2015-08-15 11:44:57	Mikaela	that is how I used it with JuiceSSH when I was still on Android
2015-08-15 11:45:06	zutto	Raku_: weechat-android
2015-08-15 11:45:09	gb	yes also a large issue for me with no way to easilly ctrl + to make it bigger
2015-08-15 11:45:25	Raku_	I use weechat android
2015-08-15 11:45:33	Raku_	But, no tab complete for stufr
2015-08-15 11:45:42	Raku_	And iset and things dont work well
2015-08-15 11:45:48	zutto	w-a does support nick autocompletion
2015-08-15 11:45:53	gb	i am using an iphone presently
2015-08-15 11:46:15	gb	so no weechat unless i use glowing-bear

2015-08-15 11:46:30	Raku_	I can do command completeion or anything
2015-08-15 11:46:51	miiiiiklos	can run more weechat?
2015-08-15 11:46:59	miiiiiklos	from one user?
2015-08-15 11:47:01	Raku_	I like glowing bear but the app tenda to get killed since it doesn't run as a service like weechat-android
2015-08-15 11:47:06	gb	yes try -d
2015-08-15 11:47:49	gb	that was for you miiiiiklos
2015-08-15 11:47:53	Raku_	I will never be satisfied until i can have my 8-way window split on my phone
2015-08-15 11:48:09	gb	weechat -d someotherdir
2015-08-15 11:49:14	gb	Raku_: hit the phone multiple times with a large percussive maintenance device like a sledgehammer and you will soon have multiple windows
2015-08-15 11:49:16	miiiiiklos	what?
2015-08-15 11:49:37	Raku_	gb: thanks ;)
2015-08-15 11:51:06	miiiiiklos	gb
2015-08-15 11:51:17	miiiiiklos	with  that can use another port?
2015-08-15 11:51:30	miiiiiklos	must be user ith that?
2015-08-15 11:53:17	gb	miiiiiklos: you can use whatever port you like as it is a complete new config dir
2015-08-15 11:53:43	miiiiiklos	oh coool
2015-08-15 11:54:10	miiiiiklos	so like weechat -d /home/miklos/another
2015-08-15 11:54:13	miiiiiklos	?
2015-08-15 11:54:23	miiiiiklos	there make config?
2015-08-15 11:54:24	gb	but you can run multiple servers from a single weechat too no need to run multiple weechats
2015-08-15 11:54:44	miiiiiklos	yes i know
2015-08-15 11:54:52	miiiiiklos	i need add more client lol
2015-08-15 11:54:58	gb	not too sure what you are trying to do though so perhaps try to explain what you need to do
2015-08-15 11:55:33	miiiiiklos	so like weechat -d /home/miklos/another in that folder will be new config?
2015-08-15 11:55:42	gb	yes
2015-08-15 11:56:13	gb	you could even cp your .weechat to there so you get all the same installed scripts/settings before running
2015-08-15 11:56:36	miiiiiklos	hm cool
2015-08-15 11:57:25	gb	but if you leave it empty weechat will create a new default config in the directory specified on /quit /save or /upgrade
2015-08-15 11:57:44	miiiiiklos	172.98.199.232/phpsysinfo/ how many eechat can run?
2015-08-15 11:57:46	miiiiiklos	lol
2015-08-15 11:57:54	miiiiiklos	w*
2015-08-15 11:58:32	gb	in theory limited to the os/resources available

2015-08-15 22:04:54	t3chguy	so it only shows channels that you are also in

2015-08-15 22:05:11	t3chguy	repeating the nick shows more info
2015-08-15 22:05:21	winny	yes i assumed that is the case, though pretty certain some irc clients check joined channel lists
2015-08-15 22:05:29	Mikaela	there is nyuszika7h's answer though, but that is too difficult when compared to just /grep word

2015-08-16 00:02:00	diegoviola	some people will paste characters like this one in weechat: ᗣ ᗧ
2015-08-16 00:03:03	diegoviola	I know this has nothing to do with weechat, but is there a reason why I can't see those characters in xterm/urxvt/st and I can with VTE based terminals like gnome-terminal/termite?

2015-08-16 09:46:03	gb	i could never get that setting to work on target_buffer
2015-08-16 09:46:20	@FlashCode	the target buffer feature can not open a new buffer
2015-08-16 09:46:26	gb	even after removing all layouts, etc
2015-08-16 09:46:28	@FlashCode	so it will go to pv buffer only if already opened
2015-08-16 09:46:52	gb	but how to open that pv buffer for it?
2015-08-16 09:47:20	@FlashCode	that's a just a pv with a given nick
2015-08-16 09:47:47	@FlashCode	busy with release now, I can help you lated if needed ;)
2015-08-16 09:47:49	gb	oh so if sumone /query's you and you ctcp version them it appears in that buffer
2015-08-16 09:47:57	@FlashCode	later*
2015-08-16 09:48:04	gb	ok

2015-08-16 09:48:58	gb	seems i misunderstood the /help, etc for it
2015-08-16 09:51:17	@FlashCode	the pv value can be used for example for /whois, if you have a pv with the nick, the reply will be in pv
2015-08-16 09:52:58	gb	that's ok if i can get a common pv buffer for all nicks but i will ask about it when release is done if i remember
2015-08-16 09:55:05	@FlashCode	there's no "pv for all nicks" in weechat
2015-08-16 09:55:34	@FlashCode	so you can not group replies on a single buffer in weechat
2015-08-16 09:55:51	@FlashCode	the "pv" will just send on the pv with the nick in message, and only if already existing
2015-08-16 09:57:24	gb	i'm thinking a merge all pv's
2015-08-16 09:58:40	gb	but an issue for later

2015-08-16 10:09:38	gb	maybe it could be something handled by nils queryman even :)
2015-08-16 10:12:40	gb	alissa did you work out a trigger for inputbar q to /buffer close?
2015-08-16 10:13:42	gb	it seems you could probably bind /buffer close to alt c if needed

2015-08-16 13:40:30	@FlashCode	voldial: the default term color can not be changed by weechat, it's a terminal setting
2015-08-16 13:40:55	+weebot	-git(core)- FlashCode: core: rename "scripts" directory to "build-scripts"
2015-08-16 13:40:59	@FlashCode	and as I said, "default" should be different from "white"
2015-08-16 13:41:11	@FlashCode	if you have setup white in your terminal, you can either change that, either change weechat settings
2015-08-16 13:42:10	@FlashCode	anyway I recommend to change the nick colors if you're using 256 colors (recommended)
2015-08-16 13:42:15	@FlashCode	with my value above
2015-08-16 13:42:36	@FlashCode	weechat does not use 256 colors by default in colors, because this would not work if your terminal doesn't support 256 colors
2015-08-16 13:43:03	voldial	xterm's def color is white bg on black fg I think, it's likely black bg on white fg is the next most common default.

2015-08-16 13:44:58	voldial	but I think the point might still be valid. white text is second most common after the xterm def of black. maybe xterm isnt the most common terminal
2015-08-16 13:45:43	voldial	but just as black is not in weechat.color.chat_nick_colors, white prob shouldnt be either (if weechat does not want to check the current term color and work around it)
2015-08-16 13:47:51	@FlashCode	I just tried xterm, the "white" is bold, "default" is not

2015-08-16 13:51:01	voldial	FlashCode: that's the point. black is default, and black is (for a good reason) not in the default colors. I'm saying maybe white shouldnt be either. Or I should code up something to check what the term's fg color is.

2015-08-16 13:53:12	@FlashCode	voldial: why not changing the color in weechat? and that's all, very easy :)
2015-08-16 13:53:35	@FlashCode	the options are there to be customized according to your needs
2015-08-16 13:53:38	voldial	maybe there is no generic way to know the term color, if it's not term independent, then there's no reasonable way to integrate that "feature" into weechat
2015-08-16 13:53:52	voldial	just sayin'
2015-08-16 13:54:26	@FlashCode	and one day if someone sets cyan as default term color, should I remove cyan too?
2015-08-16 13:54:31	voldial	no
2015-08-16 13:54:36	voldial	but you could say that for black
2015-08-16 13:54:59	voldial	hence trying to detect
2015-08-16 13:54:59	@FlashCode	black is just because all default settings are designed for a dark background
2015-08-16 13:55:04	sim642	lets remove all colors altogether because they could be someone's default
2015-08-16 13:55:15	@FlashCode	if you have a white bg, you must reconfigure all colors anyway (some colors may not be readable)

2015-08-16 17:48:56	sim642	nick!user@host is technically a prefix I think

2015-08-16 17:56:43	sim642	because /msg doesn't actually take a mask with wildcards
2015-08-16 17:58:30	farn	https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812.html#section-3.3.1
2015-08-16 17:58:40	farn	"The <msgtarget> parameter may also be a host mask (#<mask>) or server mask ($<mask>)."
2015-08-16 17:59:39	sim642	host and server masks are different things ;)
2015-08-16 18:00:32	sim642	as in, much more specific
2015-08-16 18:02:04	farn	what else could "mask" mean in the context of /msg?
2015-08-16 18:03:38	sim642	when I read it for a moment I was lead to believe that something like "/msg sim* foo" would work, because that's also a mask
2015-08-16 18:04:52	farn	okay, it could be more explicit about that
2015-08-16 18:04:58	farn	but the question is whether all servers support that equally
2015-08-16 18:05:31	sim642	support what equally? my example doesn't even work because it's not a thing in IRC protocol
2015-08-16 18:06:57	farn	right, but explaining the whole host/server mask syntax would be a bad idea if half of the ircds out there don't accept those
2015-08-16 18:07:00	sim642	the actual host and server mask thing which the RFC talks about is extremely specfic and not sure if it gets used at all because it's an operator thing
2015-08-16 18:07:01	farn	I have no idea if they do
2015-08-16 18:07:27	sim642	the nick!user@host syntax is standard
2015-08-16 18:07:56	sim642	not sure if it actually gets used though
2015-08-16 18:08:32	sim642	I wonder what was FlashCode's intent putting that "mask" addition into that helptext
2015-08-16 18:08:49	@FlashCode	in /help msg?

2015-08-16 18:09:57	sim642	FlashCode, define mask to me
2015-08-16 18:10:23	sim642	I quoted 2812 earlier: "When wildcards are allowed in a string, it is referred as a "mask"."

2015-09-08 14:32:31	serb	Ok.
2015-09-08 14:33:05	Benguin	Should be /buffer merge <buffer you want to merge with> while on the buffer you wan't merged
2015-09-08 14:33:26	serb	Just found out this,
2015-09-08 14:33:29	Benguin	And there's probably a way to make it so that it does this on startup
2015-09-08 14:33:33	serb	However does this merging
2015-09-08 14:33:36	serb	Oh
2015-09-08 14:33:52	Benguin	I think there's a command to save the current um.. Layout of the buffers/windows
2015-09-08 14:33:58	serb	Yea, just put auto command on weechat startup "merge bla bla"

2015-09-08 14:34:14	serb	DO NOT USE. THIS SCRIPT IS BROKEN BEYOND MY ABILITY TO FIX.
2015-09-08 14:34:45	Benguin	if you have more than one such command to run on autostart, serb, consider storing the layout by doing /layout store, and then using /layout apply on the autostart instead
2015-09-08 14:34:54	Benguin	at least I think that's how you're meant to do it
2015-09-08 14:35:29	Benguin	(that way if you have multiple window split or buffer merge commands to run, you can do them all in one simpler command, I think.)
