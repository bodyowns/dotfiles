2015-04-03 03:02:45	e7th04sh	There are all those arguments, like that typing takes only insignificant amount of time, but then it does take time that could be used better, and so on and so on.

2015-04-03 03:40:17	Scott_S	IMO, with learning how to program, you should learn how to properly structure a program first. Why you use methods, why you separate things out, why everything does not belong in main(), why you should use threads.
2015-04-03 03:40:21	jrslepak	troyfriend: one "why" to consider here is "why do I want to build up a giant hierarchy of subtypes?"

2015-04-03 03:41:01	e7th04sh	you really need to have a good goal with your app. a goal will give you logical functionalities that you want, it will guide you as to what you want to achieve.

2015-04-03 04:20:19	e7th04sh	They were throwing dice, wiring and unwiring them with chance.

2015-04-03 09:09:21	Znoosey	hi frecz
2015-04-03 09:09:23	seg	i'm working off the notion that it used 'digit', so 9^5 would be the upper bound for each
2015-04-03 09:09:45	frecz	I'm currently working on a webpage, coding myself from scratch.
2015-04-03 09:09:54	Myrl	wei2912: how to write summation symbol in latex?
2015-04-03 09:09:56	wei2912	i'm just looking for a value of x that'd fit inside the range
2015-04-03 09:10:09	wei2912	Myrl: i wrote it a few times here
2015-04-03 09:10:16	wei2912	\sum^x_{i=1}{9*10^i}
2015-04-03 09:10:28	Myrl	Ah.
2015-04-03 09:10:28	wei2912	\sum^n_{i=1}{i} for sum of all numbers from 1 to n
2015-04-03 09:10:37	frecz	I would like to have a kind of membership area. Is there any free package of sort to do that?

2015-04-03 09:11:50	Myrl	wei2912: 10^(d-1) <= n <= d*9^9
2015-04-03 09:11:58	Myrl	I think.
2015-04-03 09:12:01	Myrl	Where d is the amount of digits
2015-04-03 09:12:08	frecz	Znoosey: Which one would you reccommend?
2015-04-03 09:12:11	Myrl	And n is the number.

2015-04-03 09:13:48	Znoosey	frecz: for this to work you need to be using something like php/asp.net/python/perl

2015-04-03 09:35:45	wei2912	So lets determine the upper bound. We need to find a number x*95 which gives us an x digit number. We can do this by hand. Since 95 = 59049, we need at least 5 digits. 5*95 = 295245, so with 5 digits we can make a 6 digit number. 6*95 = 354294. So 355000 seems like a reasonable upper bound to use. We could probably tighten is even further if we wanted.So lets determine the upper bound. We need to find a number x*95 which gives us an x digit num

2015-04-03 16:09:02	Znoosey	strings are awesome, as people tend to think it is always a good idea to parse them with these huge regexes that they don't comment and leave it for the guy maininting it to figure out when something goes wrong
2015-04-03 16:09:04	Znoosey	which it will
2015-04-03 16:09:10	Henke37	puddlejumper, even write a c++ parser?
2015-04-03 16:09:12	Znoosey	after about 5 days

2015-04-03 16:09:20	pyon	puddlejumper: Another problem with stringly typed data is cultural: It leads newbies to think in terms of strings everywhere. And, out in the wild, most code is written by people who didn't focus so much on principles, so they never got past the "strings everywhere" phase of professional development.

2015-04-03 22:50:35	Ori_B	gde33: in a single datacenter with 10gige, you're already looking at 200ms for a single consistent key-value update using paxos.

2015-04-03 22:50:53	e7th04sh	Jimbawb: facebook keeps diffferent users in different versions of interface.
2015-04-03 22:51:00	DarkCthulhu	jrslepak: Hmm.. okay.  I get the difference; this is looking for definite availability; but I think even with SSA, I might need to KILL expressions while propagating available expressions.
2015-04-03 22:51:02	e7th04sh	I even suspect it keeps older users in older versions, lol.
2015-04-03 22:51:25	e7th04sh	Some poeple are chosen at random as testers of release candidates.

2015-04-03 22:51:34	Jimbawb	Not true. My interface has gone through various versions and each and every one has maintained the ability to browse chronologically.
2015-04-03 22:51:50	e7th04sh	And my current version does not, at least, have that option in the open.

2015-04-03 22:52:27	Jimbawb	Humour me - sign in and have a look. To the right of 'News Feed' there's an arrow. Clicking it gives two options, 'Top Stories' and 'Most Recent'

2015-04-03 22:52:38	RumpledElf	Jimbawb: where's the third option to show ALL posts
2015-04-03 22:52:39	Jimbawb	I'll admit, it sometimes forgets your preference and needs to be set again, but it's there.
2015-04-03 22:52:46	gde33	Ori_B: the nerdy answer for me is that I wrote an rss aggregator that runs in the browser and parses 20 000 feeds with ease, I could share the 2000 newest results with someone else and merge in their feed list
2015-04-03 22:52:54	e7th04sh	Jimbawb: yes, I had that arrow - two years ago or something.
2015-04-03 22:52:56	nisstyre	neat
2015-04-03 22:53:02	RumpledElf	it undoes your preference for most recent almost every visit, and most recent and top posts tend to be completely different
2015-04-03 22:53:05	nisstyre	aren't there already RSS aggregators though?
2015-04-03 22:53:07	Ori_B	gde33: runs in the browser -- sounds like a single node to me.

2015-04-03 23:41:53	DarkCthulhu	Storyteller: It maintained compatibility with a lot of C and is a decent language which gives you abstraction alongside efficiency. The reason newer languages with better safety haven't taken over yet is probably all that C++ code that already exists and all that expertise that is relatively easy to find.

2015-04-04 00:04:12	DarkCthulhu	JanC: Hmm.. but as long as they satisfy the as-if rule, the C++ standard shouldn't prevent any implementation to be swapped into its place. But yeah, can't really tell why. It might be better for some lower-level optimizations that C++ needs to do.
2015-04-04 00:04:19	JanC	if one algo finishes in 1 second and another in 1 minute, that could certainly break compatibility in some applications

2015-04-04 00:05:49	DarkCthulhu	Hmmm.. fair point, but the standard makes no guarantees about the actual time taken, only asymptotic bounds on the abstract machine.

2015-04-04 01:14:39	BlueProtoman	Even if your code is the most scalable in the world, if it's a hobby project that you don't have the time, motivation, or manpower to scale then it's moot.  That's why I say that the value of adding a virtual method without a sensible default implementation to a class tree varies by project.

Standard ML forces all mutation to go through a specific type constructor: ref. OCaml, on the other hand, allows any record type to contain mutable fields, and reference cells are just a specific case of a struct with a mutable field. And you are reminded of this ugly fact every time you pattern match on

2015-04-04 04:36:19	pyon	yh: In Haskell, <, >, <=, >= always do the right thing - use the Ord instance. In OCaml, they always do the *wrong* thing - use the built-in broken one-size-fits-all, just-as-broken-as-C comparison.

2015-04-04 11:57:05	Henke37	Airon, it is very simple. EITHER the if or the else part runs. never both
2015-04-04 11:57:28	Henke37	and the "else if" setup is just that the else part contains another if statement
2015-04-04 11:57:59	Henke37	so the second if statement doesn't even get evaluated if the first one evaluates to true

2015-04-04 12:03:55	Airon	Alright, so, if you wanted to check multiple things you'd use if, if else, if else, if else

2015-04-04 19:34:17	pyon	tens0r: Reflection is primarily used to do metaprogramming. As a (bad) example, if you are making a SOAP Web service, you can use .NET attributes to mark those methods that must be exposed in the WSDL.
2015-04-04 19:34:50	pyon	tens0r: Then either you or, most likely, a framework, will use reflection to read those attributes and generate the WSDL.

2015-04-04 20:31:09	cousteau	not 100% sure what cellular automata are (I can only think on Conway's GoL) but probably can be used for that

2015-04-04 21:32:14	DarkCthulhu	AndreasL: Sometimes there is no need to do the operations in order if the effect overall is the same. Strict ordering would impose the restriction that the order of issue is the same as the order of execution, while the relaxed one allows for more leeway as long as the result is as-if they occurred in the same order. I think this is the distinction.

2015-04-04 21:33:49	AndreasL	DarkCthulhu, thanks. When you're referring to operations here, are you referring to operations made by multiple threads? I.e. that the orders of atomic operations between thread A, B and C can be relaxed, so that even if A issues the order first, it may be performed after B's operation?

2015-04-04 21:35:19	DarkCthulhu	The C++ std::memory_order's memory_order_relaxed parameter does that. It removes all ordering constraints and keeps only atomicity.
2015-04-04 21:36:12	AndreasL	DarkCthulhu, so, just to make it perfectly clear in my mind: If A calls atomic_swap(myvar, mylocalvar), and then sometime _later_, B calls atomic_swap(myvar, mylocalvar), these two operations may appear in any order when relaxed, whereas if they are strict, A must perform the operation first, then B?

2015-04-05 00:21:57	himiku	mattwilliam: usually it works like this: you put element, if it has not enough space - it allocates twice as much as it already has, then copies current data into new area, then adds new element. if it has space preallocated, it just puts element in. you can ask it to preallocate some amount of memory to avoid early reallocation.

2015-04-05 00:26:59	pyon	mattwilliam: Data has to be copied from main memory to the cache.
2015-04-05 00:27:22	pyon	mattwilliam: Whatever used to be in the cache also needs to be copied back to main memory.
2015-04-05 00:27:27	mark06	himiku: why do I need to pass perfmondata.cpp to the compiler if perfmondata.o is already specified in that command line?
2015-04-05 00:27:33	tmp765	mark06: those functions are callbacks, declared in winperf.h, programmer implements them. OS will call them in specific moments.
2015-04-05 00:27:44	pyon	mattwilliam: But at this stage, chances are worrying about this isn't going to be productive. :-P
2015-04-05 00:27:49	mattwilliam	okay ... so what else apart from cache miss, is a downside to linked list?
2015-04-05 00:28:03	himiku	mattwilliam: no offense, but if you ask such basic questions, you better start simple (e.g. vector) and see how it works. you will be surprised how fast computers really are. unless you have millions of records, it will do just fine (for the data and processing you mentioned).
2015-04-05 00:28:40	pyon	mattwilliam: You have to allocate lots of small nodes, instead of a single big one, which can put some strain on the allocator.
2015-04-05 00:29:01	mattwilliam	himiku, I am practically embarrassed while asking these stupid questions too - but I learn so much by talking to you guys. It may appear like I am wasting your time, but I will really do follow up on whatever advice is being given here.

2015-04-05 00:29:39	mark06	tmp765: so the compiler is complaining that it can't find PM_OPEN_PROC and such? cause it seems it can't find the functions themselves as I linked
2015-04-05 00:30:01	mattwilliam	So pyon, himiku - I am thinking of this, how about determining some sort of a pattern to guess the approximate capacity required for a given "vector" and then allocate that space.

2015-04-05 00:30:49	mattwilliam	so it wud be a calculated guess. Downside, I will almost always overallocate or underallocate. But overall, it wud be efficient right?
2015-04-05 00:30:54	pyon	mattwilliam: Depends on your use case. The suggestion to use a std::deque, I don't know by whom, was a good one. It's an intermediate point between linked lists and vectors.
2015-04-05 00:31:00	himiku	mattwilliam: it's good thing to as and to learn, but don't try to do everything the best possible way. development is an iterative process. you can always review your code and improve it later. while you have little code, it won't be painful at all

2015-04-05 02:38:42	DarkCthulhu	himiku, the right solution would leverage the fact that there are n^2 processors and only n items which gives you the capability of assigning n processors to each item to check every other item in parallel against this one and write your results to some other array.

2015-04-05 02:52:13	himiku	DarkCthulhu: if a node can take more than one pass to update, then on the next pass some nodes may need early update even if they aren't source nodes
2015-04-05 02:52:25	DarkCthulhu	Ori_B, yeah.. You're right. I was emphasizing the ordering being opposite.
2015-04-05 02:53:04	DarkCthulhu	himiku, If you do reverse postorder (because topological sort isn't defined for graphs with cycles) , you can additionally adopt a worklist based approach.
2015-04-05 02:53:27	Ori_B	himiku: and what do you mean by "update"?
2015-04-05 02:53:28	himiku	snyp: and what do i need to accomplish in this particular case by combining A and C? or you mean, what will be inside B? then it's kinda unknown, as B is some component, and i only work with its interface
2015-04-05 02:53:42	Ori_B	what would you mean by "early update"?
2015-04-05 02:53:55	DarkCthulhu	himiku, You'd rely on the fact that the only values that need updating are the whose input changed in the previous pass. It's very similar to the approach used to traverse control flow graphs in compiler land.
2015-04-05 02:54:03	snyp	himiku: yeah, do a dfs, find the reverse post order number for each node, then process each node according to that number.
2015-04-05 02:55:25	DarkCthulhu	himiku, you need to know what type of system it is. If the transfer function is monotonic and distributive, you can use a conservative assumption for output and it will terminate. Else, you have to use a different approach.
2015-04-05 02:55:38	Ori_B	himiku: more or less, I think you want to model your problem as a semilattice
2015-04-05 02:55:39	himiku	Ori_B: by update i mean calling some function on a node, that will actually process data. and by early update i mean, that a node needs to be updated early, because it already has some internal state caused by previous pass. if i update it lately, neighbour nodes will change and it could affect the processing
2015-04-05 02:56:17	Ori_B	himiku: or rather, if your problem can be modelled as a semilattice, you just do bottom up.

2015-04-05 04:12:28	GeneralVagueness	I get that using some set bunch of data can only tell you so much about real-world performance, but it's also the only way to do a direct comparison with another processor, so if you want to advocate for asynchronous processing, you should get data on performance by an asynchronous processor with some known or at least predictable data, so you or someone else can apply the scientific method and see what kind of

2015-04-05 06:08:54	DarkCthulhu	Scholarly Markdown.
2015-04-05 06:09:22	DarkCthulhu	I agree the plain old one is pretty bad.
2015-04-05 06:09:49	Ori_B	the problem is that markdown doesn't actually give the control you want.
2015-04-05 06:10:06	Ori_B	if you use LaTeX at the same level as what Markdown allows, the syntax is actually not that distant.
2015-04-05 06:10:16	Ori_B	empty line between paragraphs, $$ for equations, etc.
2015-04-05 06:10:30	wei2912	the plain old one isn't bad but it's not a replacement for latex
2015-04-05 06:10:52	Ori_B	that's 99% the way I use LaTeX, and it almost always does what I want at that level.

2015-04-05 06:12:12	Ori_B	the reason tables in markdown suck less, I guess, is because there's no concept of page breaking, which is where all of the tabularshit packages fall apart, usually.
2015-04-05 06:12:15	Ori_B	hm.
2015-04-05 06:12:59	Ori_B	but, IMO, basically latex is painless up to a superset of markdown's functionality.

2015-04-05 12:14:54	hellyeah	my idea is to back up into db after sometimes take data on back up db to a file
2015-04-05 12:15:16	hellyeah	because my program will work constantly may be million n of data in a week

2015-04-05 12:17:11	PlanckWalk	Usually you want a lot more frequent backup than once per month.
2015-04-05 12:17:18	o0elise0o	if im understanding what you said, it does make sense
2015-04-05 12:17:33	o0elise0o	but yeah you'd have smaller data and better fault tolerance if you did it more often
2015-04-05 12:17:38	PlanckWalk	The point of backup is that it's what you have to use when things go wrong.  Not if they go wrong, when.
2015-04-05 12:17:54	hellyeah	what is fault tolarence?
2015-04-05 12:18:05	o0elise0o	ability to recover from a problem

2015-04-05 19:21:48	Myrl	pyon: If I have an intersection(set intersection) algorithm, and both inputs are sorted. The algorithm goes as that if the current element of the first is smaller than the second, then go to the next element of the first, and vice versa.

2015-04-05 20:48:46	dysfunc-pyon-al	Myrl[Mobile]: Because it involves lots of definitions.

2015-08-11 14:03:45	merijn	hio: You can fight this by reducing the state space (i.e. amount of things that can change and number of places you can change them from)
2015-08-11 14:03:54	koollman	hio: every line has a potential effect on every other line. Fixing it require limiting interaction between each lines. encapsulation, abstraction, modularisation and so on

You can pop up an informational messagebox but it just has a message and an OK button. I'm looking around and all I see is custom code snippets and even then there's a few problems because if you pop up the dialog box "modally" then you have to hide the main form. I'm amazed.

2015-08-11 22:47:25	VeiledSpectre	Heya, is anyone familiar with leveraging the pcap networking library?  From my reading it is possible to capture packets sent to a NIC/network controller from an external system.  I was wondering if the library can also theoretically sniff packets that are sent to the NIC for transmission and inject/modify filtered packets at the kernel network layer silently without an application knowing anything about it.

That way you're including disabled people and don't create specific patches as an afterthought. By the way python.org is the first website I've seen that uses JSON-LD (for linked data) in the sourcecode. <script type="application/ld+json">

2015-11-20 19:50:10	sunnymilk	it is my understanding that executing programs (which may or may not even terminate) will generally be slower than static content that doesnt get modified by a program that runs while you read the page
2015-11-20 19:50:22	hello234123	is that what it "blocking sockets" mean?

2015-11-20 19:57:54	DarkCthulhu_	sunnymilk, you are trusting the page in the first place if you're doing something on it. And you're relying on the search engine that found it to ensure that it isn't weird like that.
2015-11-20 19:57:57	Fernandos	heh, CORS. The last mile yeah I wish every site whitelisted all domains and had websockets. Long way to go to create inter-operative websites. Would help bypassing virtual api/spec wall-gardens created by FB and GOOG.
2015-11-20 19:58:31	DarkCthulhu_	It's a tradeoff for me if you have the bandwidth. Saving ones own time. It's also true that some websites overdo it though. A lot of the stuff could be done purely with CSS and runs scripts in the legacy way instead.
