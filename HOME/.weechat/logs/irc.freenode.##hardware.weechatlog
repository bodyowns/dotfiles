2015-06-07 01:23:38	Nokaji	fortunately I am right
2015-06-07 01:23:46	doomlord	if fossil fuels are biotic, we're returning carbon to the atmosphere

2015-06-07 01:42:52	Amarande	can't have significant gamma or neutron radiation, and you also have to beware of Bremsstrahlung (i.e., beta emitters require more shielding than alpha)
2015-06-07 01:44:02	Amarande	also the half-life can't be too long (it'll be too weak) or too short (it'll burn out too fast, plus short-lived nuclides tend to emit too much harmful high-energy radiation, that's how Marie Curie contracted the blood abnormalities she died from)

2015-06-07 05:00:42	ℹ 	yukari is now known as tsumugini
2015-06-07 05:01:33	Amarande	Yeah, Haswell sucks like that
2015-06-07 05:01:42	Amarande	because of the FIVR you can't avoid an overvolt every friggin time AVX is used
2015-06-07 05:01:50	Amarande	that raises CPU temps I've found by as much as 15C
2015-06-07 05:01:54	BullHorn	:O
2015-06-07 05:01:59	BullHorn	yeah, usually playing+recording is fine
2015-06-07 05:02:14	BullHorn	but seeing as i manage testing of new features/mods, i also host the server sometimes and that reaaaaally drives the CPU
2015-06-07 05:02:17	b0oing	Thanks for clearing it up, Branes.
2015-06-07 05:02:29	Amarande	e.g., with the Akasa cooler I get 60C normal 100% load and 75C in Prime95
2015-06-07 05:02:41	Amarande	with stock I get 90C normal 100% load and 100C+loss of turbo in Prime95
2015-06-07 05:02:53	Amarande	(yeah, I got a pretty bad thermal specimen ... this is a Xeon E3 that can't even OC LOL)
2015-06-07 05:02:55	Branes	b0oing: np mate. Better to ask a question and appear dumb for a few minutes, than to remain silent and appear dumb for life :)
2015-06-07 05:04:05	BullHorn	yeah, cpu will have to be my next upgrade
2015-06-07 05:04:05	b0oing	The other day, I said to my brother: "Nah. Audio CDs don't actually have files on a file system. They have... um... tracks... and... it's like... digital audio... wave... files... or something..."
2015-06-07 05:04:09	BullHorn	possibly/probably with a mobo ;x
2015-06-07 05:04:17	BullHorn	i hear about that skylake? skyline thing?

2015-06-07 05:06:24	Amarande	BTW, if you're a Linux fan, better stick with Broadwell, Haswell, or a Bridge
2015-06-07 05:06:33	Amarande	Skylake means even your IGP needs a damn blob
2015-06-07 05:07:06	Amarande	and I'm not even sure that even comes with the good side of closed source drivers either
2015-06-07 05:07:18	Amarande	(i.e., that you can get OpenGL 4.x on Linux through blobs but not on open source)
2015-06-07 05:07:43	Amarande	since I think it's a "firmware blob" and the open source driver runs on top of it, so you get the patent limitations of open source *and* the annoyance of a closed source blob!
2015-06-07 05:07:59	Amarande	man, Intel, why :(
2015-06-07 05:08:49	Branes	Blame Microsoft and the deals they have with ODMs.

2015-06-07 07:14:53	mchelen	a bad psu can certainly cause problems
2015-06-07 07:15:02	mchelen	get a new battery :D
2015-06-07 07:15:19	mchelen	or another better charger and see if it helps
2015-06-07 07:15:44	julianjames	yeah... i can't imagine what could be wrong with the charger that's causing this though
2015-06-07 07:15:49	julianjames	it's not that it's not supplying enough power

2015-06-07 07:16:06	julianjames	because after my computer shuts off, i can reboot it with no cord and there's still battery power left
2015-06-07 07:16:11	mchelen	julianjames: the voltage could dip at peak current draw

2015-06-07 07:17:32	Varden	why did you give him a ransom?
2015-06-07 07:17:36	mchelen	ebay pretty much screws over sellers, so the customer can probably still leave feedback
2015-06-07 07:17:52	mchelen	if you have a record of the misbehavior you could try to get them banned
2015-06-07 07:18:00	julianjames	mchelen: that would make sense. i guess my first step should be to replace the charger and hope the problem doesn't continue and that it was a faulty charger causing the problem
2015-06-07 07:18:28	Haxxa	Varden: he stated he had to pay credit card fees and tthe refund didn't cover that
2015-06-07 07:18:32	mchelen	julianjames: yeah at least then you have something you can swap to isolate the problem
2015-06-07 07:18:39	julianjames	mchelen: i'm pretty sure that i've had a similar problem trying my friends lower-wattage charger, where it shuts off before the battery actually drains
2015-06-07 07:18:50	julianjames	mchelen: i'm going to try that again to verify

2015-06-07 07:33:23	Amarande	either you will win it way lower, or someone will be so desperate that they have to have it, so they'll go beyond you
2015-06-07 07:33:31	Amarande	I guess the only real problem is you might be accused by ebay of being a seller shill
2015-06-07 07:33:41	Foxhoundz	mm

2015-06-07 11:24:48	james41382	What surprises me is the design of some laptops. I've seen some that are a breeze to disassemble and reapply TIM, but then there are some that are a huge pain to take apart.
