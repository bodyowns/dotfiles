2014-07-10 20:09:00	eklavya	any ideas?
2014-07-10 20:09:29	BtbN	name() is not a getter for that variable.
2014-07-10 20:09:41	BtbN	It also has the same name as the variable, so that won't work.
2014-07-10 20:09:49	uvatbc	eklavya: Have you declared and filled in the member function "name" ?

2014-07-10 20:22:49	kbidd	I'm new to building qt... I'm trying to build qt5 statically on Windows (using mingw and msys) .  I configured qt with -static, and it told me it configured successfully, but warned that I must ensure all modules are built-in since I'm static.  Is there anything special I need to do to make sure webkit is built in (the only module I'm planning on using in my project)?

2014-07-10 23:46:29	kailoAtWork	Yeah, I did that. Only reason I only had an .h is because I was testing the build pipeline
2014-07-10 23:46:45	kailoAtWork	won't be the case as development kicks off

2014-07-10 23:52:55	JoeBullet	Hello.. Is there some way to move QQuickView with dragmove? I tried setting transparent background but the View itself does not move, only root object?
2014-07-10 23:54:14	thiago	kailoAtWork: where's the SOURCES line?
2014-07-10 23:55:02	kailoAtWork	thiago, I split the implementation into a source to resolve the issue.  Hence the 'sure as hell.'
2014-07-10 23:56:14	+jpnurmi	JoeBullet: instead of using QQuickView, you could create a Window in QML and move that

2014-07-06 14:54:39	@peppe	it should be automatic, i.e. Qt will pick up the KDE style itself
2014-07-06 14:55:09	@peppe	run your application under QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1 and see if that's indeed happening
2014-07-06 14:55:17	@peppe	also, in Qt 4, you should have qconfig to control that

2014-07-06 14:56:20	@peppe	there are a number of reasons why that automatic loading may be failing, though. the typical case is that the plugin requires extra Qt libraries, which in turn are picked up from system paths (instead of your own compiled copy of Qt), and you can't mix and match Qt versions inside the same binary

2014-07-06 14:57:27	@peppe	for instance you get your app using QtCore and QtGui (from your own compiled Qt), while the KDE style plugin links to (some KDE library which links to) QtDbus or QtSvg, and these latter are picked up from system paths => Qt version conflict => style plugin not loaded
