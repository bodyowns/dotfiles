2015-04-15 05:05:20	the-anconia	I have a mongoose schema that has a reference to another schema. I have to specify a type but String literally stores the entire schema as a string rather than an object. Is there a way around this?

2015-04-15 05:09:44	the-anconia	So just have my type as ObjectIDs and populate everything else when I need it?

2015-04-15 05:10:47	ian_mac	well you can do something like postedBy: {type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User'}
2015-04-15 05:10:57	ian_mac	where User is the name of the schema that you are referencing
2015-04-15 05:11:09	ian_mac	been a while since I really played with it - YMMV
