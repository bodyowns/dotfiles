So they're not talking about ailesystem labels as in blkid printing out block devices with LABEL="mylabel" are they? I also changed the selinux context on a couple of files on that test volume and they didn't get relabeled, selinux context wise. Am I right thinking that the later is because it is a "SELinux targeted policy relabel?" If so, how do I find out what is "targeted."

2014-08-07 00:37:41	nullvibe	otherwise, chrome will use whatever http proxy you specify happily and not care about crypto. it's even one of the major ways browser security is so easily thwarted/exploited in a mitm sense
2014-08-07 00:37:45	rocketeer	spacebarbarian: aside from that, a MitM proxy will need access to its own signing key, and the client will need to either ignore cert warnings or trust the signing key the proxy is using. It will generate on the fly certs for sites you visit, return its generated cert to the client (effectively terminating an ssl connection with the client), and then make its own 2nd ssl connection to the destination. This allows the proxy to read/see all
