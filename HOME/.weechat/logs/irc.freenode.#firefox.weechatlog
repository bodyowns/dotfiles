2015-08-03 15:09:42	wodim	ctrl+l ?
2015-08-03 15:09:55	wodim	I never use the URL bar.
2015-08-03 15:09:59	wodim	I just hit Command+L.
2015-08-03 15:10:14	wodim	Well I mean, I don’t click it.

2015-08-03 15:12:35	wodim	Command+L if you are on a Mac, which I guess you are not.
2015-08-03 15:13:05	body	specing: pentadactyl drops the support for the newer versions of firefox right ?

2015-08-03 17:00:47	Tealyf	yeah me too
2015-08-03 17:00:49	specing	I should also put firefox into a virtual machine
2015-08-03 17:01:02	specing	but no time right now for that
2015-08-03 17:01:26	wodim	You might want to visit a psychiatrist.
2015-08-03 17:02:17	specing	wodim: firefox is several million lines of code which were proven time and time again to be fairly insecure
2015-08-03 17:02:31	wodim	And so is your OS, whatever it is.
2015-08-03 17:02:40	specing	nope
2015-08-03 17:03:15	Tealyf	(I think I have started a war :/ )
2015-08-03 17:03:40	specing	there is no war really, wodim just wants to point out how little he/she/it knows about computers
2015-08-03 17:03:47	specing	and/or security
2015-08-03 17:03:57	wodim	^
2015-08-03 17:04:15	wodim	It might be that, but it could also be that you are paranoid and/or misinformed.
2015-08-03 17:04:23	Tealyf	I like the "it"
2015-08-03 17:05:05	specing	Tealyf: there really are "its". People that have no sex (I'm not kidding)
2015-08-03 17:05:19	Tealyf	specing: yeah I know
2015-08-03 17:05:33	Tealyf	I think the best way to avoid a maximum troubles is to stop being on internet
2015-08-03 17:05:46	specing	no way to do that in this day and age, heh
2015-08-03 17:05:53	wodim	People that have no sex?
2015-08-03 17:05:57	wodim	I call those “eunuchs”.
