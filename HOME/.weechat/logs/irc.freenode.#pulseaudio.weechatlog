2015-09-07 14:49:55	ftonello	body: You have only monitors, that's why you can't hear anything.
2015-09-07 14:50:22	ftonello	body: run list cards now
2015-09-07 14:51:07	ftonello	Your main card should create input and output profile

2015-09-07 14:58:45	ftonello	body: your system settings should have this type of support. On KDE you can use audio settings from kmixer.
